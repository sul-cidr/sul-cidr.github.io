      <title>Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the essence, and the form fades away at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;청계 차일수: 득의망상 (得意忘象)&lt;br&gt;
Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the Essence, and the Form Fades Away&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stanford East Asia Library presents an exhibition by the South Korean artist Cheonggea Ilsu Cha from November 18, 2024 to February 20, 2025. Artist Cha has dedicated his 40-year career to the mastery of ‘literati’ painting.  The literati genre combines written word with a painterly interpretation of text, a form of art that has been practiced by the scholarly elite in Korea for over 400 years. His work has been featured at the prestigious Grand Art Exhibition of Korea, and he has held eight solo exhibitions.&lt;br&gt;
A significant number of Korean scholars practiced literati painting during the Joseon Dynasty, which extended from 1392 to 1897. Literati painting reflects the scholar’s observation, understanding and interpretation of a poetic topic. The artist strives for aesthetic discipline; the text must be no longer than what the topic minimally requires. So too must the artist seek simplicity in his visual vocabulary.  The exhibition is inspired by the philosophy of Tŭgŭi mangsang (得意忘象), which emphasizes abandoning artifice in order to seek the true nature of things.  The works at the exhibition employ the use of ink and a constrained palette of color using materials such as traditional Korean paper, scrolls, and fans. The paintings touch on a wide variety of topics, from nature to philosophical reflections to expressions of human emotion. Cha’s work is inspired by the artistic sensibility of his predecessors. Visitors to the museum will find paintings imbued with a classic aesthetic, timeless charm, and a lively wit.&lt;br&gt;
This exhibition of Cha’s Korean literati paintings was curated by Jee-Young Park, Korean Studies Librarian at Stanford East Asia Library; Ji Soo Kim, M.A. in  Museum Studies from San Francisco State University; and Wooju Chong, M. A. in Center for East Asian Studies from Stanford University, in consultation with the East Asia Library Exhibits Committee.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: Authenticity by Design at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet is at an inflection point. With the growth of mis/disinformation, artificial intelligence and synthetic media, trust in information faces unprecedented threats. Authenticity is not guaranteed. At the same time, new technologies–referred to as “Web 3”–present opportunities to protect the integrity of data. These solutions can be applied to critical practices including investigative journalism, historical archiving, and the admissibility of legal evidence. This exhibit, curated by the &lt;a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/"&gt;Starling Lab for Data Integrity&lt;/a&gt;, asks: How might we design information systems for authenticity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/visitor-access" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New Deal &amp; The Federal Writers' Project at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-UT_h28D9ylo9I3qEOfJJXmbaL_Ol8wq4VIw_k6PEU4/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New Deal &amp;amp; The Federal Writers' Project | Selections from the Bruce and Rachel Jeffer Collection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on view May 6, 2024, through January 26, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by childhood automobile trips across the U.S. with his father and a lifelong love of American history and literature, Los Angeles attorney Bruce Jeffer assembled a magnificent collection—totaling nearly two thousand titles—of the Federal Writers’ Project and related WPA and New Deal publications. He and his wife Rachel gifted it to the Stanford Libraries Department of Special Collections in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created as a New Deal program within the Works Progress Administration in 1935, the Federal Writers’ Project (Federal Writers’ Program 1939–1943) employed as many as six thousand writers, researchers, and editors in fifty-two state and territorial offices and produced a prodigious number of publications—including the American Guide Series, oral histories, ethnographies, collections of folklore and books for children—well over one thousand, but likely many more: the exact number is unknowable, and new discoveries have surfaced in the wake of each successive bibliography. Over sixty years, Jeffer’s passion for collecting the output of the Federal Writers’ Project and its offshoots brought him into contact with the foremost antiquarian book dealers of the day, former Writers’ Project employees, and leading collectors across the United States. With his wife Rachel, he made great use of auctions, eBay, and trades with other notable collectors and dealers. Through the decades, he searched for these publications by visiting bookstores in towns and cities around the country, directly contacting booksellers, and later maintaining a private network of like-minded collectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two core influences in Jeffer’s collecting activities were his close relationship with collector Fred Board of Connecticut and collector/book dealer Arthur Scharf of Pennsylvania. Board’s own collection of the State Guides (apart from his larger FWP collection) later served as an inspiration to his great-nephew Scott Borchert, which led Borchert to write his recent excellent history of the Project, &lt;i&gt;Republic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America&lt;/i&gt; (New York, 2021). Besides selling and trading, Arthur Scharf was a source of bibliographic information on the FWP publications. Like most serious collectors of the FWP, when Evanell Powell self-published her ambitious (if amateur) WPA Writers’ Publication: &lt;i&gt;A complete bibliographic checklist… of items, major and minor, of the Federal Writers' Project and Program&lt;/i&gt; (Palm Beach, 1974), Jeffer took advantage of the information there to hunt for more titles—and to find many titles unknown to Powell, historians, and scholars. Of the over twelve hundred published FWP titles in the Jeffer collection, approximately one hundred and fifty FWP items were unknown to Powell and historians, thus representing an excellent opportunity for further research. The presence of sixteen original, unpublished FWP works adds significantly to the prospects for research in the collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collecting the often ephemeral publications that characterized the richness and diversity, as well as controversy, of the project’s output, Jeffer has been guided by a desire to document this seminal period in American history, preserve it for posterity, and make it broadly available to students and researchers. In addition to rare published items, Jeffer sought out unpublished material as well—always with an eye for unique material that, in the words of one FWP catalog, embodied the project’s mission of “presenting America to all Americans.”  His collection contains copies of a number of exceedingly scarce titles, typescripts of unpublished works, and presentation copies gifted to New Deal luminaries such as Harry L. Hopkins, as well as publications from allied agencies such as the Federal Art Project, the Museum Extension Project, the Federal Theatre Project, and the Federal Music Project.  &lt;br&gt;
As demonstrated throughout the exhibit, The FWP’s lasting influence on literary and ethnographic work since the 1930s is strong, and the cultural resonance of the project continues unabated—including serving as the inspiration for a proposed twenty-first-century FWP, congressional legislation (Bill # HR 3054) introduced during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021 by Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA and Stanford, B.A., B.S., '91) and Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Benjamin Stone, Associate Director of Special Collections and Curator for American and British History; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their expert cataloging of books and manuscripts: Nancy Lorimer, Kay Teel, and their staff in the Metadata Department; For their assessment of materials Kristen St. John and Kimberly Kwan in Conservation Services; For his photography services Wayne Vanderkuil in the Digital Production Group; Glynn Edwards, Ann Myers, Brian Bethel, Gurudarshan Khalsa and especially Esther Wan in the Collection Services division of the Department of Special Collections, and Ben Albritton and Ever Rodriguez in Rare Books, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Library Hours page &lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epicenters: Navigating Recovery and Renewal from Disasters at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;In the wake of disaster, maps play many roles, shaping understanding of the event in the immediate aftermath, serving as visceral portrayals for those who were not there, and communicating both scale and extent of the tragedy. They gavanize support for rebuilding by showing new possible futures and can be used to memorialize the event, inscribing the memory over the landscape. Drawing upon sources from historical representations to contemporary satellite imagery, the maps in this exhibition explore various ways communities use maps to make sense of calamity and move forward from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;The exhibition was curated by Stanford student Muhammad Dhafer, winner of the 2024 California Map Society student exhibition competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This exhibition is ongoing and will be available until February 28th, 2024. To view the exhibit, visit the David Rumsey Map Center during its public drop-in hours.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Russophones' Conspiratorial Thinking in Estonia: Three Years Post-Invasion to Ukraine at Encina Commons, room 123</title>
      <description>&lt;p style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;In this talk, based on the longitudinal ethnography of different Russophone groups in Estonia,  Dr. Astapova will tackle conspiracy theories around the war in Ukraine as they emerged at the beginning of the war and developed after, demonstrating that they have been far from static. She will explore the reasons and vulnerabilities behind this group’s conspiratorial thinking, which are much more complex than a mere result of the Russian Federation propaganda. Finally, she will analyze other narratives that tend to gravitate toward conspiracy theories about the war and some genres that, as ethnography shows, often accompany conspiracy talk, such as humor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anastasiya Astapova&lt;/b&gt; is an Associate Professor of Folkloristics (University of Tartu, Estonia) and a member of Estonian Young Academy of Sciences. Previously, she was interested in the research of post-socialist humor and rumor under authoritarianism (which, along with other publications, resulted in her monograph Humor and Rumor in the Post-Soviet Authoritarian State. Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield, 2021). In 2016-2020, Astapova was a board member of the COST project “Comparative Analysis of Conspiracy Theories”, within which she published a co-edited Conspiracy Theories in Eastern Europe: Tropes and Trends (Routledge, 2020) and a co-authored Conspiracy Theories and the Nordic Countries (Routledge, 2020), among other works. Astapova is one of the founding members of CONNOR: Nordic Network of Conspiracy Theory Research. At the moment, Astapova is a principal investigator in Estonian Science Foundation project “COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories: Contents, Channels, and Target Groups”, a member of Horizon project DELIAH: Democratic Literacy and Humor”, and a member of ERC grant “Conspirations: Conflicts over Conspiracy Theories”. Anastasiya Astapova is an&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Estonia Short Term Visiting Scholar at CREEES.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Georeferencing in QGIS (Jan 21st) at Branner Earth Sciences Library </title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This workshop covers the basics of georeferencing static images in a GIS using the open source GIS package QGIS. Georeferenced images or maps can be used as contextual layers in a GIS project, or as part of a data extraction process to convert static map data into digital vector data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabletop Tuesdays: Kurt Vonnegut’s GHQ: The Lost Board Game at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this session of Tabletop Tuesday, we will be exploring Kurt Vonnegut’s long-unpublished board game, its connections to his published work, and examining the research process behind its recent release in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, the American author Kurt Vonnegut (1922-2007) was struggling to make a living by writing and decided to create a board game as a way to earn money. He came up with a two-player wargame called &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/03/crosswords/kurt-vonnegut-board-game-ghq.html"&gt;GHQ (General Headquarters)&lt;/a&gt;, which he then unsuccessfully pitched to board game companies. When Vonnegut’s writing career took off, he never returned to GHQ, with his notes and prototypes going into his archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Geoff Engelstein, a tabletop game designer, heard about this unpublished game and was curious to learn more. He got in touch with Vonnegut’s archive and estate to see what remained of it, and &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/422478/ghq"&gt;the end result&lt;/a&gt; was the 2024 publication of GHQ (General Headquarters). Engelstein describes the journey to publication in his &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/1/blogpost/165310/developer-diary-kurt-vonneguts-ghq"&gt;Developer Diary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game also offers us a new perspective on Vonnegut’s life and work, since this WWII game involving the use of tanks and military forces to capture the enemy’s headquarters was created by a vehemently antiwar writer. For example, his son theorizes that creating a board game was one way in which Vonnegut coped with PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us to consider the relevance of this board game for Vonnegut's body of work and the value of the archive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tabletop Tuesdays is an event series held on the third Tuesday of each month. At these events, we feature a selection of board games and collection items from across SUL's holdings around a specific theme. Drop in to learn about the month's featured game(s) and/or try some of the board games we have for open play at the Silicon Valley Archives.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep Learning Based Framework to Identify Undocumented Orphaned Oil and Gas Wells from Historical Maps (Bay Area Open Science Group Meeting)</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month, the Bay Area Open Science Group will be joined by Dr. Fabio Ciulla, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Climate and Ecosystem Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He earned his M.S. degrees in Physics from the University of Rome La Sapienza and completed his Ph.D. at Northeastern University in Boston, focusing on nonlinear dynamics of diffusive phenomena on geographical networks. At Berkeley Lab, his research includes developing data-driven models to predict water quality and leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to detect undocumented legacy oil and gas wells across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undocumented Orphaned Wells (UOWs) in the U.S. pose environmental risks, including methane leaks and groundwater contamination. This study used historical topographic maps, available as open-source data from USGS, and a U-Net computer vision model to detect well symbols in the maps and flag UOWs when there is no match among known wells. Applied to areas in California and Oklahoma, it revealed 1,301 potential UOWs with high spatial accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Bay Area Open Science Group&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Bay Area Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area (and more!) academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning. Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>European Security in a New Transatlantic Era: A Conversation with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia Margus Tsahkna and Prof. Michael McFaul at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia Margus Tsahkna and Director of the Freeman Spogli Institute Michael McFaul on Russia’s war against Ukraine, its global implications, and transatlantic collaboration:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;European Security in a New Transatlantic Era&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister Tsahkna will present Estonia’s take on strengthening transatlantic cooperation in the increasingly interconnected world. The only way to tackle current global geopolitical challenges is for the transatlantic partnership to remain strong and effective. There is much to gain from working together on both sides of the Atlantic in economic, security, or energy-related areas. The Minister will touch upon respective ongoing discussions in Estonia, but also the European Union and NATO, especially in reaction to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Achieving just and lasting peace in Ukraine, with a clear path for the country into the EU and NATO, remains not only the key issue for European security but will have a broader positive impact globally. Protecting international law, advancing the rules-based international order, countering hybrid attacks, and supporting those who fight for their sovereignty and freedom are all complex tasks that require the highest degree of cooperation and unity between partners who share the same fundamental values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Margus Tsahkna&lt;/b&gt; is the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Estonia from 17 April 2023. He is a member of the Eesti 200 party. Previously, Mr. Tsahkna served as a long-time member of the Estonian Parliament. He also served as Minister of Defence (2016–2017) and Minister of Social Protection (2015–2016). He studied at the School of Theology and Religious Studies and the School of Law at the University of Tartu from 1996–2002 and at the University of Toronto from 1999–2000, specializing in international law.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael McFaul&lt;/b&gt; is the Director at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, the Ken Olivier and Angela Nomellini Professor of International Studies in the Department of Political Science, and the Peter and Helen Bing Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1995. He served for five years in the Obama administration, first as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs at the National Security Council at the White House (2009-2012), and then as U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation (2012-2014).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Opening remarks will be delivered by &lt;b&gt;Michael Keller&lt;/b&gt;, Vice Provost and University Librarian.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This in-person event is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/ciJUscMuehXWDxwbA"&gt;Registration is required.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabletop Tuesdays: Studying Data with the game Rescue Polar Bears: Data &amp; Temperature at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month's Tabletop Tuesdays is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;a series for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rescue Polar Bears: Data &amp;amp; Temperature is a cooperative game based on Rescue Polar Bears with a new data and temperature system added to the game design to make the strategy more diversified. The consumption of fossil fuel and releasing of greenhouse gases yield the global warming. Around the North Pole, the last icebergs are melting and the polar bears are facing the risk of being extinct. The players form a scientific organization. They try to collect data about climate change to persuade the governments to change their energy policy. At the same time, they also need to prevent polar bears from sinking into the freezing water. Each player drives a rescue ship of different ability to complete the mission on the Arctic Ocean. As long as the players collectively gather enough data, they win together. However, if too many polar bears sink into the water, everyone loses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabletop Tuesdays is an event series held on the third Tuesday of each month. At these events, we feature a selection of board games and collection items from across SUL's holdings around a specific theme. Drop in to learn about the month's featured game(s) and/or try some of the board games we have for open play at the Silicon Valley Archives.&lt;/p&gt;
