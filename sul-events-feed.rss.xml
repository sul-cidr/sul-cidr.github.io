      <title>Encoding: Computers as a Global Medium at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the Libraries&amp;rsquo; extensive collections, &lt;i&gt;Encoding&lt;/i&gt; illustrates two fundamental shifts in the history of computing: recasting computers as a communications medium rather than solely as a means for calculation by &amp;ldquo;number crunching&amp;rdquo; and developing encoding systems that encompassed more of the world&amp;rsquo;s text and language systems. The result was global computing: a technology that today encompasses virtually all the world&amp;rsquo;s cultural, financial, educational and entertainment media. Notable collections include &lt;i&gt;the Unicode Collection&lt;/i&gt;, t&lt;i&gt;he Louis Rosenblum Papers&lt;/i&gt;, &amp;amp; &lt;i&gt;the Thomas S. Mullaney East Asian Information Technology History Collection&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/using/access-and-privileges"&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Banned Books Week Display  at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the American Library Association&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Banned Books Week,&amp;quot; Green Library presents a display of some of the most challenged books from the last few years. With calls to remove books from U.S. public and school libraries at an all time high, this display serves as a reminder of the important role that libraries play in enabling the freedom to read.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Embodied Knowledge: Women and Science Before Silicon Valley  at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Exhibition to show August 11, 2023 &amp;mdash; March 24, 2024, in Cecil H. Green Library&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XI86kAgaFf0qg6EU61aYFhe7fHT18gvg/view?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;u style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Embodied Knowledge: Women and Science before Silicon Valley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XI86kAgaFf0qg6EU61aYFhe7fHT18gvg/view?usp=sharing"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Register &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/embodied_knowledge"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the reception.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;An extension of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Embodied Knowledge &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Exhibition entitled:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt; Early Stanford Women in STEM &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;will show from September 25 &amp;mdash; December 15, 2023, in the Hohbach Hall Entrance Case, Silicon Valley Archives, Green Library.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Embodied Knowledge: Women and Science before Silicon Valley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt; explores the long history of women pursuing scientific, medical, and technical knowledge from the Middle Ages through the mid-twentieth century. It showcases Stanford&amp;rsquo;s considerable holdings for this subject, including the role of our own university in this history. Our exhibition displays these materials from colonial Mexico, North America, Western Europe, Britain, Japan, Korea, South Asia, and the Middle East. We invite viewers to see them as building blocks in a global history of gender and knowledge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Many women participated in making knowledge. Long before the rise of the institutional laboratory, the body and the home were domestic laboratories. Largely denied access to institutions of research and learning, women improvised their own opportunities. We have looked for patterns rather than exceptions, documenting women&amp;rsquo;s scientific labor and the practical realities of earning a living. The variety of scientific and medical publications written by, for, and about women reminds us that this is a history of the many rather than the few. Every author has a reading public&amp;mdash;the most successful ones reached large international audiences. Individual histories reveal larger networks and often exist in relationship to institutions. We explore the evolution of women&amp;rsquo;s scientific education, research, publications, and careers with these questions in mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Hypatia of Alexandria (355&amp;ndash;415 CE) provides a symbolic point of departure for our exhibition. She was renowned for her lectures in Greek philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy in Alexandria and was brutally murdered by Christians; none of her writings survive, but her reputation endured. Our opening case also includes Maria Sibylla Merian&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous and insightful Metamorphosis of Surinamese Insects (1705). Merian (1647&amp;ndash;1717) was a trained artist and self-educated naturalist who left her husband, collaborated with her daughters, and traveled all the way to Dutch Surinam to observe insects. There she learned about the medicinal uses of Caribbean plants from indigenous and enslaved women. Her life and career were their own metamorphosis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Bringing a long global story home, we end our exhibition by reflecting on women and science &amp;quot;before Silicon Valley.&amp;quot; From its inception in 1891, Stanford educated and encouraged women of science. Focusing on the early decades, we have extracted interesting Stanford women scientists, engineers, and physicians&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;from the archives, exploring their intellectual passions and pursuits. Louise Brown Nash&amp;rsquo;s portfolio of scientific illustrations in the opening case illuminates the kind of opportunity talented women unexpectedly discovered at Stanford, where Nash was the first &amp;quot;Artist of the Hopkins Seaside Laboratory.&amp;quot; This pioneering generation of Stanford women found possibilities even as they confronted their limits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;The next generations of Stanford women bridge the gap between the growth of women&amp;rsquo;s higher education in the late nineteenth century, the era of women&amp;rsquo;s suffrage, and the postwar boom in American universities, scientific research, and technological innovation. A 1957 memo of one of the earliest meetings of Stanford women faculty records three women in science and engineering&amp;mdash;Myra Keen (paleontology), Mary Sunseri (mathematics), and Irmgard Fl&amp;uuml;gge-Lotz (aeronautical engineering). Keen and Fl&amp;uuml;gge-Lotz also open this exhibition. Keen&amp;rsquo;s career as a curator and professor illuminates the end of an era when natural history was an important part of Stanford&amp;rsquo;s mission. Fl&amp;uuml;gge-Lotz&amp;rsquo;s arrival at Stanford marks the growth of aeronautical engineering. Her work brought her great acclaim in Germany, where she headed a research institute, and led to a spousal lectureship at postwar Stanford. In 1957, Keen was in her third year as an assistant professor and Fl&amp;uuml;gge-Lotz was still a lecturer&amp;mdash;until 1960 when the conspicuous gap between her reputation and status became too uncomfortable. Both women help us to understand the importance of second careers, a subject explored with selections from two major Stanford archives in the exhibit case downstairs in the Silicon Valley Archive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;The renowned physicist and chemist Marie Curie would have surely enjoyed meeting the Stanford women we have encountered, had she been able to come as a visiting professor in the early 1930s. Every episode in this exhibition deserves further study, as do others we could not include. We invite you to explore these histories and their artifacts and get to know some very interesting scientific women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;The exhibition was curated by Stanford History Professor Paula Findlen with contributions from a diverse group of faculty, curators, and graduate students across the institution. Deardra Fuzzell, exhibits designer, managed the production and installation of the exhibition assisted by Elizabeth Fischbach, retired exhibits designer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. M-F, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sat, and 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sun.

      <title>Tabletop Tuesdays: Gaming while Indigenous at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This session will feature&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.weyodi.com/"&gt;Weyodi&amp;nbsp;OldBear&lt;/a&gt;, Comanche writer and storyteller, who will talk about her experience with building new worlds in the development of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Coyote &amp;amp; Crow&lt;/i&gt;, as well as the importance of gaming in thinking about Indigenous Futurism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coyoteandcrow.net/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coyote &amp;amp; Crow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a sci-fi and fantasy roleplaying game set in an alternate future. Developed and led by a team of Natives from all over North America, this game envisions a world where colonization never happened and Indigenous nations rose to future prominence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tabletop Tuesdays i&lt;/i&gt;s an event series held on the third Tuesday of each month. At these events, we feature a selection of board games and collection items from across SUL&amp;#39;s holdings around a specific theme. Drop in to learn about the month&amp;#39;s featured game(s) and/or try some of the board games we have for open play at the Silicon Valley Archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Barry Lawrence Ruderman Conference on Cartography at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b style="font-size:13.125px; font-style:normal; text-align:start"&gt;The conference, hosted by the David Rumsey Map Center and Barry Lawrence Ruderman Antique Maps, will focus on maps &amp;amp; data visualization.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Maps can communicate all kinds of information. While geographic features and toponyms are frequently highlighted, arraying information in a spatial layout has proven useful for centuries. Maps and data visualization go hand-in-hand, but in ways that are complex and deserve critical examination; this is why they are the focus of the fourth biennial Ruderman Conference on Cartography, held October 18-20, 2023 at the David Rumsey Map Center at Stanford University. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Speakers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds and specializations will share their expertise about historical, design, and digital applications of data visualization. Attendees will examine examples of maps that share information in a variety of ways and discuss the potential and limitations of the medium in the past, present, and for the future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none"&gt;Keynote speakers include Michael Friendly (York University, Canada), who will discuss the history of data visualization, and Karen Lewis (the Ohio State University), who will share the mapping methodology and design behind the recovery of Underground Railway routes and stories.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Raja Adal  at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming Raja Adal on October 19 in Hohbach Hall.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rethinking the Role of the Printing Press and Typewriter Outside of the World of Latin Characters: A Large-Scale Analysis of Writing and Reproduction Technologies in the Mitsui Mi&amp;rsquo;ike Mine Archive, 1889-1941&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, the history of the book, of bureaucratic cultures, and of information societies has introduced us to the centrality of printing presses and typewriters in European and North American offices. This presentation explores the material history of writing outside of the world of Latin characters through the indexing of one of the largest business archives in modern Japan, the Mitsui Mi&amp;rsquo;ike Mine archive. Over several years, this indexing project ordered the 38,096 pages in this archive into 20,713 individual documents, categorized according to criteria that reveal the practice of document production, circulation, storage, and consumption in the offices of a large Japanese firm over the course of a half century from 1889 to 1941. Although the printing press and typewriter have a role in the offices of the Mitsui Mi&amp;rsquo;ike Mine, when we look not at discourses but at practices, it turns out that in a society in which most texts are composed of thousands of logographic and phonographic symbols, writing and reproduction technologies other than the printing press and typewriter are much more prominent. Through the large-scale analysis of the Mitsui Mi&amp;rsquo;ike Mine archive, this presentation begins to chart a theory of the practice of writing and reproduction, from the brush to Unicode, in the context of global scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with &lt;b&gt;Chris Miller&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Tufts University) and &lt;b&gt;Stephen Kotkin&lt;/b&gt; on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chip War: The Fight for the World&amp;#39;s Most Critical Technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, military, economic, and geopolitical power are built on a foundation of computer chips. Virtually everything&amp;mdash;from missiles to microwaves, smartphones to the stock market&amp;mdash;runs on chips. Until recently, America designed and built the most advanced chips and used its control over computing power to maintain its lead as the world&amp;#39;s leading superpower. The Soviet Union--which designed and manufactured many of its most advanced semiconductors in the Baltic States--could never keep up. Now, America&amp;#39;s edge is slipping, undermined by competitors in Taiwan, Korea, Europe, and, above all, China. Today, China, which spends more money each year importing chips than it spends importing oil, is pouring billions into a chip-building initiative to catch up to the US, and using this to build a military that threatens Taiwan, the beating heart of the digital world. At stake is America&amp;#39;s military superiority and economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPEAKER:&amp;nbsp;Chris&amp;nbsp;Miller&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the author&amp;nbsp;of &amp;quot;Chip&amp;nbsp;War: The Fight for the World&amp;#39;s Most Critical Technology,&amp;quot; a geopolitical history&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the computer&amp;nbsp;chip. He previously wrote three other books on Russia, including &amp;quot;Putinomics: Power and Money in Resurgent Russia;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We Shall Be Masters: Russia&amp;#39;s Pivots to East Asia from Peter the Great to Putin;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy: Mikhail Gorbachev and the Collapse&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the USSR.&amp;quot; He also serves as Associate Professor&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;International History at Tufts University, where his research focuses on technology, geopolitics, economics, international affairs, and Russia. He has previously served as the Associate Director&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the Brady-Johnson Program in Grand Strategy at Yale, a lecturer at the New Economic School in Moscow, a visiting researcher at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research associate at the Brookings Institution, and as a fellow at the German Marshall Fund&amp;#39;s Transatlantic Academy. He received his PhD and MA from Yale University and his BA in history from Harvard University.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DISCUSSANT: Stephen Kotkin&lt;/b&gt; is&amp;nbsp;Kleinheinz Senior Fellow at Hoover Institution and&amp;nbsp;senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (Stanford University).&amp;nbsp;He is also the Birkelund Professor in History and International Affairs emeritus at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs (formerly the Woodrow Wilson School), where he taught for 33 years.&amp;nbsp;He earned his PhD at the University of California&amp;ndash;Berkeley and has been conducting research in the Hoover Library &amp;amp; Archives for more than three decades. Kotkin&amp;rsquo;s research encompasses geopolitics and authoritarian regimes in history and in the present.&amp;nbsp;His publications include&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929&amp;ndash;1941&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Penguin, 2017) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Stalin: Paradoxes of Power, 1878&amp;ndash;1928&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;(Penguin, 2014), two parts of a planned three-volume history of Russian power in the world and of Stalin&amp;rsquo;s power in Russia.&amp;nbsp;He has also written a history of the Stalin system&amp;rsquo;s rise from a street-level perspective,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Magnetic Mountain: Stalinism as a Civilization&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(University of California 1995); and a trilogy analyzing Communism&amp;rsquo;s demise, of which two volumes have appeared thus far:&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Armageddon Averted: The Soviet Collapse 1970&amp;ndash;2000&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;(Oxford, 2001; rev. ed. 2008) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Uncivil Society: 1989 and the Implosion of the Communist&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Establishment&lt;/i&gt;, with a contribution by Jan T.

      <title>HOWLoween 2023: Celebrating National Wolf Awareness Week at Stanford Libraries at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-wolf-awareness-week-third-week-in-october/#:~:text=Wolf%20Awareness%20Week%20became%20a,October%20as%20Wolf%20Awareness%20Week."&gt;National Wolf Awareness Week&lt;/a&gt; takes place on the third week of October and is intended to &amp;quot;celebrate the unique place of wolves in the animal kingdom and learn more about their threatened place in the natural world today.&amp;quot; This year will mark the third year of celebration at Stanford Libraries, after &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/howloween_2022_celebrating_wolf_awareness_week_at_stanford_libraries_on_oct_17-22#:~:text=Our%202021%20celebration%20of%20HOWLoween,October%2016%2D22%2C%202022.&amp;amp;text=This%20session%20of%20Tabletop%20Tuesday,their%20depictions%20in%20popular%20media."&gt;HOWLoween 2022&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230604200003/https://library.stanford.edu/blogs/stanford-libraries-blog/2021/10/howloween-2021-celebrating-wolf-awareness-week-stanford"&gt;HOWLoween 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of HOWLoween is to learn more about wolves, to examine the human fascination with wolves, and also to explore the meanings and characteristics that humans associate with wolves through various cultural forms of expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Program&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:00pm: &amp;ldquo;Introduction and welcome: The meanings of wolves&amp;rdquo;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Kathleen Smith (Curator, Germanic Collections &amp;amp; Medieval Studies, Stanford Libraries)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;The wolf in Comanche folklore and tradition&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Weyodi OldBear (Writer and Storyteller)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wolf plays a very different role in Indigenous/Native American cultures than it does in Western European traditions such as fairy tales and accounts from the medieval to the present. This session will present some of the ways in which the wolf appears in Comanche tales and traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2:00pm: &amp;ldquo;A wolf in the children&amp;rsquo;s hospital: Sculptures that tell stories&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Antonia Dapena-Tretter (Art Curator, Stanford Children&amp;rsquo;s Health)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is there a &lt;a href="https://newhospital.stanfordchildrens.org/art/gray-wolf/"&gt;giant gray wolf sculpture&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of Stanford Children&amp;rsquo;s Health, a hospital for children facing serious illness? What does it mean to those around it, and how can we use this sculpture, and others, to explore stories of illness, resilience, and community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coffee Break&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3:00pm: &amp;ldquo;The Big Bold Wolf? A study to investigate personality in captive gray wolves (Canis lupus)&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Yasmeen Ghavamian (Animal Biology PhD Student, University of California, Davis)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of ongoing research at the California Wolf Center and Oakland Zoo, this talk will provide an overview of animal personality research in addition to the methodology UC Davis researchers are using to assess personality in wolves, outcomes of animal care staff ratings of wolf personality, and the impacts this research holds for welfare and conservation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4:00pm: Panel discussion among all speakers: &amp;ldquo;Telling wolf stories&amp;rdquo;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speaker Biographies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.weyodi.com/"&gt;Weyodi OldBear&lt;/a&gt; (she/her)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weyodi OldBear (she/her) was born on the shores of Long Island Sound among her father&amp;rsquo;s people but raised among her mother&amp;rsquo;s people, the Comanche Nation of Oklahoma, where she is an enrolled voting citizen. After the death of her grandparents in 2013 and 2014 she left Oklahoma for other parts of traditional Comanche territory. &amp;nbsp;She&amp;rsquo;s written 4 novels, hundreds of poems, numerous speculative fiction and science fiction short stories in addition to a historical play about her great great grandparents Weckeah OldBear and Quanah Parker, and is one of the principal writers for the groundbreaking Indigenous Futurist tabletop Role Playing Game Coyote &amp;amp; Crow. In 2018 she was awarded the Imagining Indigenous Futurisms prize for her story &amp;ldquo;Red Lessons.&amp;rdquo; Weyodi has two novel publications pending in 2024, As Many Ships As Stars with Android Press and Chunky Atakwasi: Finder of Lost Loves, a graphic novel from Native Realities Press, with art by Sadekaronhes Esquivel. Weyodi reckons her lifelong focus on speculative fiction is the result of a childhood surrounded by elderly Comanches with a lively interest in both the past and the future as well as a distinctly non-mainstream world view. Today Weyodi lives in Albuquerque, heading her large extended household, on the traditional nomadic route of her band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Antonia Dapena-Tretter (she/her)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antonia earned her Masters degree in Art History from the University of Toronto with an emphasis on modern and contemporary art. Her research has taken on a variety of different forms, from public speaking engagements at museums and universities to articles in peer-reviewed journals and art magazines. Antonia is passionate about sharing art with the public through educational and cross-disciplinary learning opportunities. In this capacity, she has held managerial positions at institutions like The Kreeger Museum and The Walt Disney Family Museum, and has exposed thousands of students, educators, and underserved populations to the expressive possibilities of art-making and animation. Believing in the power of art to heal, Antonia currently holds the position of Art Curator at Stanford Children&amp;#39;s Health. In this role, she oversees all acquisitions, installations, temporary displays, and conservation measures for a robust permanent collection of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yasmeen Ghavamian (she/her)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yasmeen is a graduate student (PhD Animal Biology) in the Animal Behavior and Cognition Lab of the Department of Animal Science at the University of California, Davis. She has a BA in Biology and an MS in Biology from Sonoma State University. Her master&amp;rsquo;s research at Sonoma State University investigated the effects of complex feeding enrichment on the stereotypic behavior of the sun bears at Oakland Zoo. For her PhD, Yasmeen is researching how the captive North America gray wolf (Canis lupus) personality may impact cognitive enrichment engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/germanic-studies"&gt;Kathleen M. Smith&lt;/a&gt; (she/her)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kathleen M. Smith is the subject specialist for the Germanic Collections &amp;amp; Medieval Studies at Stanford Libraries. Prior to Stanford, she worked in the Research and Development Department of the State and University Library in G&amp;ouml;ttingen, Germany.

      <title>Google Earth Engine 101 (Nov 3,2023) at Branner Earth Sciences Library</title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Earth Engine 101: Introduction to Earth Engine for beginners&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Earth Engine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://earthengine.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Google Earth Engine &lt;/a&gt;is a geospatial processing service. With Earth Engine, you can perform geospatial processing at scale, powered by Google Cloud Platform. The purpose of Earth Engine is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an interactive platform for geospatial algorithm development at scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable high-impact, data-driven science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make substantive progress on global challenges that involve large geospatial datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://earthengine.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Google Earth Engine&lt;/a&gt; combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities and makes it available for scientists, researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth&amp;#39;s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Presenter: &lt;/b&gt;Stace Maples&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this workshop is for Stanford University affiliates, only.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;: The Earth Engine API (application programming interface) provides the ability to create your own algorithms to process raster and vector imagery. This session is geared toward people who would like to analyze satellite and vector data. The session will be hands-on, using the Earth Engine Javascript code editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the class will be an introduction to Remote Sensing, in general. The second half will&amp;nbsp;focus on introducing the Google Earth Engine Platform, and accessing imagery, creating composites, and running analyses over stacks of images, computing statistics on imagery, creating charts and exporting the results of your analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prerequisites: &lt;/b&gt;No previous experience with Earth Engine or JavaScript is necessary for the beginner workshop, but programming experience, basic knowledge of remote sensing and/or GIS are highly desirable. Willingness to learn programming is required. Participants with no programming experience will require additional attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get Access to Google Earth Engine Immediately!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are registering with a @Stanford.edu email address, it is possible that you already have access to Google Earth Engine, through the Stanford Geospatial Center&amp;#39;s collaboration with The Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. You can test this by going to &lt;a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/f983a2d843739e23ffb77f336ad6d4fb" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://code.earthengine.google.com/f983a2d843739e23ffb77f336ad6d4fb&lt;/a&gt; and logging in with your Stanford.edu credentials. The link should load a script that will produce a &amp;quot;Tanaka Hillshade&amp;quot; map of the terrain in the Yosemite Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find that you do not currently have access to Google Earth Engine, through your Stanford.edu credentials, please email &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:maples@stanford.edu"&gt;maples@stanford.edu&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;to request to be added to the Stanford Geospatial Center&amp;#39;s organizational GEE account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please note that we are only able to provide access to users with valid Stanford.edu credentials, and a fully sponsored SUNetID. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slides&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to GDAL/OGR, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library at Branner Earth Sciences Library</title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL/OGR) is an open-source translator library for working with geospatial data. GDAL/OGR contains a variety of useful command line utilities that can be easier or more efficient to use than standalone GIS software or rolling your own code. In this workshop you will learn how to use GDAL to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect and query datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert data between different formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update and transform spatial reference systems (projections)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clip and subset data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create tile indexes and mosaics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Recoding America: Book Talk With Jennifer Pahlka at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with &lt;b&gt;Jennifer Pahlka &lt;/b&gt;(Code for America&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ingrid Pappel&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;(Tallinn University of Technology), and &lt;b&gt;Andrew Grotto&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Stanford University) on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recoding America: Why Government is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when we most need our government to work &amp;ndash; to decarbonize our infrastructure and economy, to help the vulnerable through a pandemic, to defend ourselves against global threats &amp;ndash; it is faltering. Government at all levels has limped into the digital age, offering online services that can feel even more cumbersome than the paperwork that preceded them and widening the gap between the policy outcomes we intend and what we get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not more money or more tech we need. Government is hamstrung by a rigid, industrial-era culture, in which elites dictate policy from on high, disconnected from and too often disdainful of the details of implementation. Lofty goals morph unrecognizably as they cascade through a complex hierarchy. But there is an approach taking hold that keeps pace with today&amp;rsquo;s world and reclaims government for the people it is supposed to serve. Jennifer Pahlka shows why we must stop trying to move the government we have today onto new technology and instead consider what it would mean to truly recode American government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPEAKER: Jennifer Pahlka&lt;/b&gt; is the author of &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250266774/recodingamerica"&gt;Recoding America: Why Government is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better&lt;/a&gt;. She founded Code for America in 2010 and led the organization for ten years. In 2013, she took a leave of absence to serve as U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer under President Obama and helped found the United States Digital Service. She served on the Defense Innovation Board under Presidents Obama and Trump. At the start of the pandemic, she also co-founded United States Digital Response, which helps government meet the needs of the public with volunteer tech support. She received the Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship, and was named by Wired as one of the 25 people who has most shaped the past 25 years. Jennifer is a graduate of Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DISCUSSANT: Ingrid Pappel &lt;/b&gt;is the 2023 Global Digital Governance Fellow at Stanford University,&amp;nbsp;Associate Professor at the Department of Software Science and Vice-Dean for Master&amp;#39;s studies at the School of IT, Tallinn University of Technology. She has more than 20 years of experience in different development projects related to e-governance solutions in Estonia and abroad. She is the head of the Digi-State Technologies and Architecture research group, which addresses the complexity related to how governments can satisfy the demands of their citizens in times of need. Her research focuses on digital government ecosystems by investigating technologies that support digital transformation. Her research topics are related to the development activities in launching paperless management by creating interoperability with state registries and external and internal systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MODERATOR: Andrew J. Grotto&lt;/b&gt; is a William J. Perry International Security Fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) and&amp;nbsp;a Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution, both at Stanford University. He is also Director of the&amp;nbsp;Program on Geopolitics, Technology, and Governance (FSI).&amp;nbsp;Grotto&amp;rsquo;s research interests center on the national security and international economic dimensions of America&amp;rsquo;s global leadership in information technology innovation, and its growing reliance on this innovation for its economic and social life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The event is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/CVscSgY3mbaawRrm9"&gt;RSVP is requested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Europe’s New North?  Enduring stereotypes in the Nordic and Baltic regions at Encina Commons</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with &lt;b&gt;Daunis Auers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;(University of Latvia) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Amir Weiner&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;(Stanford University) on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Europe&amp;rsquo;s New North? &amp;nbsp;Enduring stereotypes in the Nordic and Baltic regions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stereotypes (deeply ingrained beliefs or assumptions) about nations are central to country images which in turn impact domestic economic developments and relations with other states. Stereotypes are also resistant to change and can become outdated and themselves stymie change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contemporary images of the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and the five Nordic states of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden present an interesting case study of the durability of stereotypes despite a radically changed reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three decades ago, the three Baltic states regained their sovereign independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union and started out on a path of democratic and economic development that would eventually lead them to accession to the European Union and NATO in 2004. Baltic-Nordic cooperation in the 1990s was quite intense and the initial expectation (and hope) on both sides of the Baltic Sea was that the Baltic states would gradually converge with the Nordic states, passively adopting &amp;ldquo;Nordic models&amp;rdquo; of democracy, economy and the welfare state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty years later, both Baltic and Nordic regions have changed drastically, although national stereotypes have barely shifted. This talk examines the radical transformations in politics, economics and culture in the Northern Europe and discusses why, despite these changes, stereotypes of the &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; Nordics and the &amp;ldquo;shifty&amp;rdquo; Baltics persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPEAKER: Daunis Auers&lt;/b&gt; is Professor of European Studies and Jean Monnet Chair at the University of Latvia, and serves as Director-at-large of the Association for the Advancement of Baltic Studies (AABS). He studied at the London School of Economics and defended his PhD at University College London. He has been a Fulbright Scholar at the University of California-Berkeley (2005-2006) and a Baltic-American Freedom Foundation Scholar at Wayne State University in Detroit (2014) and published widely on political parties, elections, referendums, populism and the radical right and economic competitiveness in the Baltic states. His book on The Comparative Government and Politics of the Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the 21st Century &amp;ndash; was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2015. He is currently working on a monograph analyzing Nordic-Baltic integration and is a Fulbright program Visiting Professor at the University of Washington in Seattle during the fall and winter of 2023/2024.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DISCUSSANT: Amir Weiner&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;is Director of Stanford&amp;#39;s Center for Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies and Associate Professor of Soviet History. Professor Weiner teaches and writes on totalitarian movements and regimes with a focus on the Soviet polity; population politics; the Second World War; and modern mass violence. His current research is on the KGB and the Soviet surveillance state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The event is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/Nq94qHjW6cqh6Dna8"&gt;RSVP is requested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
