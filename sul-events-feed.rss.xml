      <title>Designing Radically Inclusive Solutions Exhibition at Green Library, Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Intersectional design drives innovation while supporting social justice and environmental sustainability. It's about getting the design right for people across all of society -- from the very beginning. This exhibit takes visitors through the &lt;em&gt;Intersectional Design Cards&lt;/em&gt;, a design activity to create radically inclusive products, processes, and paradigms that was developed by an interdisciplinary team from Stanford University's Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (the d.school). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This exhibition is free and open to active Stanford ID cardholders during Green Library's operating hours. Face coverings are strongly recommended. For the most up-to-date information regarding library access, please visit &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/status" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;library.stanford.edu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rise Up for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders exhibit</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the precipitous increase in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) hate crimes throughout the United States, the staff of Stanford Libraries created the Rise Up against AAPI exhibit which focuses on the history of systemic racism against the AAPI community. The aim of this exhibit is to help educate our community and provide support and resources so that we can start the process of healing and prevent future incidents. In this exhibit, we discuss past events that have led to these reprehensible acts, including institutionalized policies that have pitted minority groups in our country against each other to weaken the other&amp;rsquo;s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that through education, our community at large can rise to action against racism at all levels of our society. From the nuanced exclusions on the playground and in the workplace, to the blatant disregard for human life demonstrated in the murders of Asian American women in Atlanta and the brutal attacks on elderly AAPI community members in California and New York&amp;mdash;we must all take an active stand against the scourge that racism is to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, this exhibit is only available online. You can access the online exhibit at &lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/riseup" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exhibits.stanford.edu/riseup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries stands with the AAPI community and denounces all hate crimes, including the recent surge in hate crimes specifically targeted at the AAPI community. We hope you will join our efforts to learn about the history of violence against the AAPI community so that we can prevent history from repeating itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Say Their Names - No More Names</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Say Their Names &amp;ndash; No More Names&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an online and in-person exhibit that highlights Black Americans who have been killed or impacted by police brutality and systemic racism. The exhibit originated in direct response to the global Black Lives Matter movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical exhibition in Green Library includes names affixed to glass panels in the Bing Wing as well as banners throughout the first floor that contain the names and faces of the featured victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/saytheirnames" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online exhibit&lt;/a&gt; displays the images and individual stories of victims, including Emmett Till, Kalief Browder, Salecia Johnson and Bettie Jones; it also calls attention to events like the Tulsa riots, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the Chicago Police Department Midnight Crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who visit Stanford can also see a large banner featuring the words &amp;#39;Know Justice Know Peace,&amp;#39; which was hung on the front entrance of Green Library commemorating the opening of the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note the physical exhibit in Green Library is currently limited to authorized Stanford ID cardholders due to COVID-19.&amp;nbsp; However, the online exhibit, which also includes photos of the physical exhibit is available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibit is sponsored by the Stanford Libraries and is a follow up to a &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/node/171904" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement of solidarity and support&lt;/a&gt; against systemic racism published by Stanford Libraries over the summer. It offers opportunities for learning, reflection and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards Global Data Migration: Challenges, Risks, and Benefits</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The increasing global data migration has emerged as one of the most significant social changes since having the power to restructure all aspects of human life, from culture to social relations interrelations with structural transitions in technological infrastructure, politics, and economy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Machine learning models are increasingly used to tackle urgent human and social challenges, including health care, immigration, and transport. These models are developed with data collected within a particular society, typically Western societies, but often applied in other societies. Data transfers have great potential benefits and can lead to significant social transformations or risks and harms. We do not have any understanding of when the data transfer from one society to another leads to potential benefits or when it leads to negative consequences. There is an urgent need for a framework that will allow to explain and potentially predict the applicability of the data models in different societies and recommend a framework for performing the data transfer in a way as to minimize the potential to fail.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This presentation addresses these urgent developments, relying on a social transformation framework developed and applied to examine the rapid change processes in (post-communist) transformation societies such as Estonia and strives to map, examine, and understand the social transformations related to global data migration. The presentation illustrates the puzzles of data migration as a social transformation using examples from diverse fields, including health care (the Ubenwa mobile phone application, developed in Canada, based on Mexican babies' cry data, applied in Nigeria to prevent birth asphyxia), forced migration (matching algorithm for relocating refugees in the US, Switzerland, Turkey, and Estonia), digital identity services (Estonian e-residency case), or most recent Ukrainian cultural heritage data rescue initiative (&lt;a href="https://www.sucho.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SUCHO&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anu Masso&lt;/strong&gt; is currently a Global Digital Governance Fellow at Stanford University, co-hosted by Stanford University Libraries Baltic Studies Program &amp; Stanford Program on Geopolitics, Technology, and Governance. She is an associate professor of big data in social sciences at Ragnar Nurkse Department of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech), Estonia. She grounded at TalTech the DataLab in 2018 after her post-doctoral studies within Marie Curie Fellowship at ETH Zürich. Her research focuses on (critical) big data studies, social transformations, and spatial mobilities; she is also known for her extensive work on social science methods and methodologies. Her publications include articles in leading peer-reviewed journals, e.g., Social Networks; New Media and Society; Information, Communication &amp; Society; Information Systems Frontiers, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies; and Population, Space and Place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br aria-hidden="true" /&gt;&lt;br aria-hidden="true" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both in-person and virtual (via Zoom) options will be offered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://forms.gle/NQecmM3cm3xnRxNNA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Register for the in-person event.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEvdOiorz8jHtzaJxkce_65zXRMZ0HdP8oF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Register for the virtual event.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/blogs/stanford-libraries-blog/2022/04/stanford-libraries-and-vabamu-launch-global-conversations" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new series of talks, lectures, and seminars focusing on the benefits and fragility of freedom. The series is co-sponsored by Stanford Libraries and &lt;a href="https://www.vabamu.ee/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
