      <title>Religion in Manga and Anime: A Poster Exhibition by IntroSems RELIGST 6N at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Introductory Seminar RELIGST 6N “Religion in Anime and Manga,” taught by Professor Michaela Mross, students explored religious themes and imagery in manga (Japanese comics) and anime (animated films or TV series). The exhibit on display in the East Asia Library features academic posters on manga and anime, such as &lt;i&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Kamisama Kiss&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Deathnote&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Jujutsu Kaisen&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&lt;/i&gt;, that the students created as their final projects. The posters aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the cultural and religious background of these modern works, produced for mainly entertainment purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is located in the 3rd floor exhibit cases at the East Asia Library. An opening reception will be held on Wednesday, March 13, from 1:30 - 2:45 PM in the East Asia Library, room 224.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibition is sponsored by Stanford Libraries, the East Asia Library, the Introductory Seminars Program, and the Department of Religious Studies&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Anna Shechtman at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming Anna Shechtman and Moira Donegan as they discuss &lt;i&gt;The Riddles of the Sphinx: Inheriting the Feminist History of the Crossword Puzzle&lt;/i&gt; on April 4, 2024, at 2:30 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Riddles of the Sphinx&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most exciting debuts of the year, with excerpts in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/what-turned-crossword-constructing-into-a-boys-club" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2024/03/cross-purposes-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Harper’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and a starred review in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780063275478" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Publisher’s Weekly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Only Anna Shechtman could have written it. A rising star in English and Media Studies as much as contemporary cultural criticism, Shechtman is both a newly appointed &lt;a href="https://english.cornell.edu/anna-shechtman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;assistant professor&lt;/a&gt; at Cornell University and, as the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; described her in 2019, the “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/12/anna-shechtman-the-new-queen-of-crosswords" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;queen of crosswords&lt;/a&gt;.” She became assistant to Will Shortz at the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; in 2013 and later went on to found the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker’s &lt;/i&gt;crossword section. She is, in short, one of the most celebrated crossword constructors of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;The Riddles of the Sphinx&lt;/i&gt; is no straightforward memoir of coming of age in the strange community of crossword obsessives. It is also an exploration of the attractions of a world defined both by the firm rules of a crossword and the limitless significations of words — where one must fit the free associations of a clue into the slot of a predetermined grid. The book is also a story about the relationship between gender and technology in modern America. Once largely the preserve of women, crossword constructing became in the second half of the twentieth century the nearly exclusive domain of men. Both through history and through her own experience, Shectman draws out the relationship between this shift and the rise of new crossword technology. “As puzzle-making became increasingly informed by computer programming,” she recently observed in the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, “it began to replicate the imbalance of tech culture.” But through both her own efforts and those of her peers, this has begun to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Riddles of the Sphinx&lt;/i&gt; documents this story while opening up rich new historical and intellectual territory to explore, drawing on Shechtman’s &lt;a href="https://www.annashechtman.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;scholarly expertise&lt;/a&gt; in the history of media and the history of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shechtman will be joined in conversation by Moira Donegan, &lt;a href="https://gender.stanford.edu/news/moira-donegan-joins-clayman-institute-writer-residence" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;writer in residence&lt;/a&gt; at the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford. A regular opinion columnist for the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt;, Donegan is a leading public intellectual and a contributor to the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;. She is currently at work on her first book, &lt;i&gt;Gone Too Far: MeToo, Backlash, and the Future of Feminist Politics&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://comm.stanford.edu/"&gt;This event is co-sponsored by the Stanford University Communication Department&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Revolutionary Concepts:  From “Self-Management” to “Sovereignty” in the Soviet Union (1987-1990) at Encina Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for an engaging talk by Juhan Saharov, Visiting Fellow at the Center for Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies, who will discuss:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revolutionary Concepts: From “Self-Management” to “Sovereignty” in the Soviet Union (1987-1990)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet Estonia was the first republic to declare its “sovereignty” (asserting the supremacy of the union republic’s laws over all-Union laws) in the Soviet Union in November 1988, setting the model for all other Soviet republics to follow. One by one, the Soviet republics declared themselves sovereign in 1989–1990, earning the name “the parade of sovereignties.” Several historians and political scientists, but also Russian presidents (from Yeltsin to Putin) have later acknowledged that the concept of “sovereignty” killed the Soviet Union, acting as the main catalyst for the dissolution of the state. But how did “sovereignty“ suddenly emerge in October 1987, when nobody had been discussing it a month earlier? Why did it start in Estonia and not in other republics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecture tells the story of Estonian scholars from the communist party membership who turned the central Soviet perestroika campaign into a local “conceptual revolution.” In September 1987, a group of Estonian scholars introduced the project of “Self-Manageable Estonia” – the idea of an economically self-sufficient Soviet republic, which aimed to place all economies under local and not Moscow's jurisdiction. Within a year, this intellectual movement mobilized the whole nation, eventually shifting the focus from “self-management” to “sovereignty.” The lecture illustrates how the debate on the economic model of Soviet Estonia led to the unintended discovery of the concept “sovereignty” in 1987, and how both concepts were exported to other Soviet republics in 1988–1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Juhan Saharov is a Research Fellow of Political Theory at the Johan Skytte Institute of Political Studies, University of Tartu. His research is focused on the intellectual history of perestroika in the Soviet republics, market socialism, and expert languages during the late Cold War period. His doctoral dissertation „From Economic Independence to Political Sovereignty: Inventing “Self-Management” in the Estonian SSR“ was awarded Main Prize for a PhD dissertation by the Estonian Research Council in 2021. He has published on the role of experts and academic communities in the Soviet perestroika in the journals like &lt;/i&gt;Contributions to the History of Concepts, Europe-Asia Studies, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Acta Historica Tallinnensia.&lt;i&gt; He is a member of the research grant „Self-Determination of Peoples in Historical Perspective” at the University of Tartu.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Juhan Saharov is holding a visiting fellowship with Stanford's Center for Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies from March–April, 2024.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The event is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/82LJ9hfo53fq5ZYm7"&gt;RSVP is requested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Celebrating the Tompkins Archives at Traitel Building</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford University Libraries is delighted to invite you to an event on Earth Day, April 22, to celebrate three wonderful additions to our Sustainability collections, the archives of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tompkinsconservation.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Tompkins Conservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Doug Tompkins&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Kris Tompkins&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us as we hear from Kris Tompkins, the Cofounder and President of Tompkins Conservation, as well as leadership from Rewilding Chile and Rewilding Argentina, and Stanford staff and faculty to learn more about their important efforts and how these archives will be used at Stanford and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://forms.gle/nUum4c1skzhk7q9J6" target="_blank"&gt;Registration is required to attend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The event is free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug and Kris Tompkins are considered to be two of the most successful conservation philanthropists in history. Through their efforts and that of Tompkins Conservation, approximately &lt;a href="http://www.tompkinsconservation.org/explore/" target="_blank"&gt;14.8 million acres of parklands&lt;/a&gt; in Chile and Argentina have been protected, helping to restore native habitats and wildlife. They helped to create or expand 15 national parks, 2 marine national parks, underwrote 32 rewilding, conservation and monitoring projects, and supported 10 community-based projects. The organization has reintroduced native species, promoted regenerative agriculture, and positioned national parks as economic engines for the local communities. Through offspring organizations—Rewilding Chile and Rewilding Argentina—the work continues today.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
The archives of Tompkins Conservation and the personal papers of Doug Tompkins and Kris Tompkins will come to Stanford University Libraries providing researchers and students access to firsthand documentation on national park creation, environmental policy, conservation, rewilding, philanthropy, and environmental activism. The collection will consist of primary and secondary resources for research and scholarship providing first-hand documentation on national park creation, environmental policy, international environmental activism, and organizational activities required to work across governmental and private entities. Due to the activities of the organization in Chile and Argentina, this archive will be relevant to researchers across Stanford and in the broader academic community studying ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, environmental and international policy, social justice, land management, and economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn more about Tompkins Conservation by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WC-SsbaFXY0?si=Z27QpGwMwOgDdFcR" target="_blank"&gt;watching this short video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bo Li&lt;/b&gt; will discuss fiscal and financial policy priorities to meet Paris Agreement goals; key policy recommendations ranging from carbon taxation to scaling up climate finance; and challenges and opportunities for international cooperation on climate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/senior-officials/Bios/bo-li"&gt;Mr. Bo Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; assumed the role of Deputy Managing Director at the IMF on August 23, 2021. He is responsible for the IMF’s work on about 90 countries as well as on a wide range of policy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining the IMF, Mr. Li worked for many years at the People’s Bank of China, most recently as Deputy Governor. He earlier headed the Monetary Policy, Monetary Policy II, and Legal and Regulation Departments, where he played an important role in the reform of state-owned banks, the drafting of China’s anti-money-laundering law, the internationalization of the renminbi, and the establishment of China’s macroprudential policy framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the PBoC, Mr. Li served as Vice Mayor of Chongqing—China’s largest municipality, with a population of over 30 million—where he oversaw the city’s financial-sector development, international trade, and foreign direct investment. Mr. Li was also Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. He started his career at the New York law firm of Davis Polk &amp;amp; Wardwell, where he was a practicing attorney for five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Li holds a Ph.D. from Stanford University and an M.A. from Boston University, both in economics, as well as a J.D., magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School. He received his undergraduate education from Renmin University of China in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family of &lt;b&gt;Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh&lt;/b&gt; donated his personal archive to the Stanford Libraries' Special Collections and endowed the Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh Memorial Lecture series to honor his legacy and to inspire future generations. Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh (1919-2004) was former Governor of the Central Bank in Taiwan. During his tenure, he was responsible for the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, and was widely recognized for achieving stability and economic growth. In his long and distinguished career as economist and development specialist, he held key positions in multilateral institutions including the Asian Development Bank, where as founding Director, he was instrumental in advancing the green revolution and in the transformation of rural Asia. &lt;a href="https://hsiehlecture.sites.stanford.edu/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more about Dr. Hsieh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabletop Tuesdays: Rising Waters at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us as we explore how board game designers are creating games like &lt;i&gt;Rising Waters&lt;/i&gt; to help educators teach historical events in the classroom. &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/357416/rising-waters"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rising Waters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a cooperative game where players experience the Mississippi flood of 1927 through the lens of the local African-American population. The game is deliberately designed to foster difficult conversations about the Jim Crow South by having players confront two forces at the same time–racism and nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tabletop Tuesdays i&lt;/i&gt;s an event series held on the third Tuesday of each month. At these events, we feature a selection of board games and collection items from across SUL's holdings around a specific theme. Drop in to learn about the month's featured game(s) and/or try some of the board games we have for open play at the Silicon Valley Archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Russia's War in Ukraine and its Implications on European Security: Why should America care? at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for an engaging discussion with Ambassador of Estonia to the U.S. Kristjan Prikk and Director of the Freeman-Spogli Institute Michael McFaul on:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Russia's War in Ukraine and its Implications on European Security: Why should America care?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than ten years into Russia's war against Ukraine and more than two years after Moscow launched a full-scale aggression, there is still no end in sight to the largest military conflict in Europe after WWII. What are the implications of this war on the security of Europe but also on the United States? What would it take to end the war and in what kind of a world will we all live on the day after it's all over? The event will feature a discussion on the possibility of a viable Western strategy for success that not only saves Ukraine but also strengthens the United States' role as the leader of the free world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Estonia's Ambassador to the U.S. &lt;b&gt;Kristjan Prikk&lt;/b&gt; started his mission in Washington, D.C. in May 2021. He is a graduate of the US Army War College and has served as the National Security Coordinator to the Prime Minister. Prior to arriving in D.C., he was the Permanent Secretary of the Estonian Ministry of Defense. Among his previous assignments are two other tours in Washington as an Estonian diplomat and work on NATO-Russia and NATO-Ukraine topics at a time when these relationships were considerably less charged than today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael McFaul&lt;/b&gt; is Director at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, the Ken Olivier and Angela Nomellini Professor of International Studies in the Department of Political Science, and the Peter and Helen Bing Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1995. He served for five years in the Obama administration, first as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs at the National Security Council at the White House (2009-2012), and then as U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation (2012-2014).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Opening remarks will be delivered by &lt;b&gt;Amir Weiner&lt;/b&gt;, Associate Professor of History and Director of Stanford's Center for Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The hybrid event is free and open to the public. To attend in person, &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/rwxd4BtZj1vHqhJ56"&gt;RSVP is requested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
