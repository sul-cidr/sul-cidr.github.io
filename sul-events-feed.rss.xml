      <title>Victoria Yau: “I slept in the mountain cloud” at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;黛文洵美：山水記憶&lt;br&gt;
Victoria Yau: “I slept in the mountain cloud” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by Stanford Libraries, the East Asia Library, and the Center for East Asian Studies. Organized and guest curated by Beryl Zhou, graduate student, Center for East Asian Studies, and Ellen Huang, Ph.D, distinguished practitioner at the Center for East Asian Studies and associate professor of art history and material culture at ArtCenter College of Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanghai-born artist Victoria Yau (1939–2023) created around 300 works of abstract ink paintings, watercolors, multimedia collages, prints, and textiles after she moved to the United States from Taipei. These artworks, spanning nearly half a century of art-making in Chicago, New York and the Southwest, testify to her commitment to abstraction and investment in material experimentation. Featuring a selection of works in a range of media—and complemented by the artist’s own writings, collections, and poetry—this exhibition asks viewers to consider the transformation of East Asian landscape painting from compositional structure into abbreviated form emphasizing texture and line. Gathered together here for the first time since her passing, the works and texts on display explore how Yau negotiated disparate experiences of geopolitical flux, immigration, and physical struggle throughout her seventy-year career. Modern in their simplicity but complex in their historical and international references, Victoria Yau’s mountain clouds, her own poetic reworking of the historical term for landscape painting, “mountain-water 山水,” signal the intricacies of international contemporary art through the vantage of an Asian diasporic woman artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New Deal &amp; The Federal Writers' Project at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-UT_h28D9ylo9I3qEOfJJXmbaL_Ol8wq4VIw_k6PEU4/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New Deal &amp;amp; The Federal Writers' Project | Selections from the Bruce and Rachel Jeffer Collection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on view May 6, 2024, through January 26, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by childhood automobile trips across the U.S. with his father and a lifelong love of American history and literature, Los Angeles attorney Bruce Jeffer assembled a magnificent collection—totaling nearly two thousand titles—of the Federal Writers’ Project and related WPA and New Deal publications. He and his wife Rachel gifted it to the Stanford Libraries Department of Special Collections in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created as a New Deal program within the Works Progress Administration in 1935, the Federal Writers’ Project (Federal Writers’ Program 1939–1943) employed as many as six thousand writers, researchers, and editors in fifty-two state and territorial offices and produced a prodigious number of publications—including the American Guide Series, oral histories, ethnographies, collections of folklore and books for children—well over one thousand, but likely many more: the exact number is unknowable, and new discoveries have surfaced in the wake of each successive bibliography. Over sixty years, Jeffer’s passion for collecting the output of the Federal Writers’ Project and its offshoots brought him into contact with the foremost antiquarian book dealers of the day, former Writers’ Project employees, and leading collectors across the United States. With his wife Rachel, he made great use of auctions, eBay, and trades with other notable collectors and dealers. Through the decades, he searched for these publications by visiting bookstores in towns and cities around the country, directly contacting booksellers, and later maintaining a private network of like-minded collectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two core influences in Jeffer’s collecting activities were his close relationship with collector Fred Board of Connecticut and collector/book dealer Arthur Scharf of Pennsylvania. Board’s own collection of the State Guides (apart from his larger FWP collection) later served as an inspiration to his great-nephew Scott Borchert, which led Borchert to write his recent excellent history of the Project, &lt;i&gt;Republic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America&lt;/i&gt; (New York, 2021). Besides selling and trading, Arthur Scharf was a source of bibliographic information on the FWP publications. Like most serious collectors of the FWP, when Evanell Powell self-published her ambitious (if amateur) WPA Writers’ Publication: &lt;i&gt;A complete bibliographic checklist… of items, major and minor, of the Federal Writers' Project and Program&lt;/i&gt; (Palm Beach, 1974), Jeffer took advantage of the information there to hunt for more titles—and to find many titles unknown to Powell, historians, and scholars. Of the over twelve hundred published FWP titles in the Jeffer collection, approximately one hundred and fifty FWP items were unknown to Powell and historians, thus representing an excellent opportunity for further research. The presence of sixteen original, unpublished FWP works adds significantly to the prospects for research in the collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collecting the often ephemeral publications that characterized the richness and diversity, as well as controversy, of the project’s output, Jeffer has been guided by a desire to document this seminal period in American history, preserve it for posterity, and make it broadly available to students and researchers. In addition to rare published items, Jeffer sought out unpublished material as well—always with an eye for unique material that, in the words of one FWP catalog, embodied the project’s mission of “presenting America to all Americans.”  His collection contains copies of a number of exceedingly scarce titles, typescripts of unpublished works, and presentation copies gifted to New Deal luminaries such as Harry L. Hopkins, as well as publications from allied agencies such as the Federal Art Project, the Museum Extension Project, the Federal Theatre Project, and the Federal Music Project.  &lt;br&gt;
As demonstrated throughout the exhibit, The FWP’s lasting influence on literary and ethnographic work since the 1930s is strong, and the cultural resonance of the project continues unabated—including serving as the inspiration for a proposed twenty-first-century FWP, congressional legislation (Bill # HR 3054) introduced during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021 by Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA and Stanford, B.A., B.S., '91) and Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Benjamin Stone, Associate Director of Special Collections and Curator for American and British History; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their expert cataloging of books and manuscripts: Nancy Lorimer, Kay Teel, and their staff in the Metadata Department; For their assessment of materials Kristen St. John and Kimberly Kwan in Conservation Services; For his photography services Wayne Vanderkuil in the Digital Production Group; Glynn Edwards, Ann Myers, Brian Bethel, Gurudarshan Khalsa and especially Esther Wan in the Collection Services division of the Department of Special Collections, and Ben Albritton and Ever Rodriguez in Rare Books, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Library Hours page &lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A World In The Making: Urbano Monte's Global Map Circa 1587 at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;In late July 1585, the Milanese noble Urbano Monte (1544-1613) decided to make an ambitious world map. The first Japanese embassy to Europe had just visited his city. Monte witnessed the spectacle surrounding the four young Japanese Christians and their Portuguese Jesuit confessor, returning to Lisbon after visiting Rome in preparation for their voyage home. The Japanese traveled with a gift of Abraham Ortelius’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Theatrum orbis terrarum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt; (1572), presumably to show the Japanese what Europe looked like in this famous Renaissance atlas. Monte was eager to create a map of Japan to satisfy European curiosity about this part of Asia. How could he bridge the vast distance separating Italy and Japan? His answer was to create a paper planisphere composed of sixty maps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This exhibition reconstructs the world of a virtually unknown Renaissance mapmaker.  Monte was inspired by the great geographers and cartographers of the day such as Mercator and Ortelius without choosing to imitate how they made their famous maps. He was curious about long-distance travel and eagerly read travel narratives, yet never got on a ship to go far from home. An avid consumer of global knowledge, Monte wanted to share what he learned. Take a close look at Urbano Monte’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;mappamundi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;, and the books, artifacts, and experiences that inspired his intellectual voyage.  See how this armchair traveler envisioned his world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This exhibition is ongoing and will be available until September 27th, 2024. To view the exhibit, visit the David Rumsey Map Center during its public drop-in hours.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For video game fans, the name Blizzard Entertainment was once synonymous with perfection. The renowned company celebrated the joy of gaming over all else, and every product it released was an instant classic: StarCraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Hearthstone, and World of Warcraft, which forever changed the video game landscape. What was once two UCLA students' simple mission — to make games they wanted to play — launched an empire with thousands of employees, millions of fans, and billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when Blizzard cancelled a buzzy project in 2013, it gave Bobby Kotick, the infamous CEO of corporate parent Activision, the excuse he needed to start cracking down on Blizzard's proud autonomy. Led by executives from McKinsey and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, Activision began invading Blizzard from the inside, driving away throngs of key employees in a push for predictability over creativity. Glitchy products, PR disasters, and mass layoffs followed, marring the company’s once pristine image. In 2021, the state of California filed a staggering lawsuit against the company for sexual misconduct and discrimination, leading to a widespread reckoning and a $69 billion acquisition that sent shockwaves through the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on firsthand interviews with more than 300 current and former employees, PLAY NICE chronicles the creativity, frustration, beauty, and betrayal across the epic 33-year saga of Blizzard Entertainment — and explores the delight and despair of what it really means to "bleed Blizzard blue." Full of colorful personalities and dramatic twists, PLAY NICE is The Social Network for the video game industry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Schreier is the New York Times bestselling author of Press Reset and Blood, Sweat, and Pixels and a reporter at Bloomberg News, where he covers the video game industry. He lives in Westchester, New York with his wife and two children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weyodi OldBear’s book,&lt;i&gt; As Many Ships As Stars&lt;/i&gt;, is a science fiction retelling of the oral tradition of Comanche horse acquisition. Set in the future the story details how modern characters Indigenize space, essentially transforming themselves to be more traditionally Comanche the more futuristic their lives become. She will discuss the story and the impetus behind its writing and give a short reading from the book, followed by a question and answer period. &lt;a href="https://pt.android-press.com/product-page/as-many-ships-as-stars-paperback"&gt;A copy of the book may be purchased here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weyodi OldBear is a voting citizen of the Comanche Nation who has been writing on a daily basis since she was 7 years old. She is disabled in a seizures and can't see much out of one eye sort of way. She writes from a Numunu (Comanche) perspective because that is her original factory setting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come expecting to leave empowered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The day before, on &lt;b&gt;October 29 &lt;/b&gt;from 12:00 to 1:00 pm, join us for a webinar on &lt;b&gt;Food Insecurities&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Karli A. Moore (Lumbee)&lt;/b&gt;, PhD Candidate in Environment and Resources, and &lt;b&gt;Jocelyn Breeland, &lt;/b&gt;Chief Communications and Marketing Officer for&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Residential &amp;amp; Dining Enterprises (R&amp;amp;DE) will discuss the issues around food/agricultural security and equity that the communities they are working with are facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karli A. Moore (Lumbee), PhD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Moving Towards Great Indigenous Food Sovereignty&lt;/i&gt; – Indigenous communities and Tribal nations sharing borders with the United States are working hard to create healthy, thriving food systems. Unfortunately, structural, economic, and societal barriers make it difficult to exercise food sovereignty. We'll talk about a number of pressing issues and folks working for solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karli A. Moore grew up on a family farm near Prospect, NC, and aspires to advance food sovereignty and economic development for Native peoples through sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jocelyn Breeland&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Black Farmers: Together Toward Justice and Equity&lt;/i&gt; – In this session, Jocelyn Breeland will outline the Black Farmers Initiative, the discrimination Black farmers still face today, and the ways the initiative is successfully advancing toward equity and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jocelyn is a member of the 2023 and 2024 Stanford IDEAL Honor Rolls. She is also an alumna of Stanford University, with a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations. She and her full-service, in-house team support R&amp;amp;DE by developing and implementing strategic plans to engage campus audiences, promote the many services R&amp;amp;DE provides for the campus, and share the results of groundbreaking R&amp;amp;DE research and innovation, such as the Black Farmers Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Chaim Gingold, "Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine"  at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming authour Chaim Gingold as he discusses his book, "Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine," on November 13, 2024, in Hohbach Hall. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As play is intrinsic to humanity, it should come as no surprise that the history of computing is veined with playful simulations and games of all kinds. From the Balinese cockfight to Los Alamos’s Monte Carlo simulations, play and games, in all their kaleidoscopic glory, reflect the diverse cultures and communities of those who make and play them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk focuses upon &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;, the genre-defying urban planning hit from 1989, and the people who made it. We’ll examine how &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;’s design counts urban planning, videogames, graphical user interfaces, and complexity science among its many influences. This set the stage for &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;’s reception and enabled Maxis, &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;’s developer, to establish relationships with wide-ranging communities: Nintendo, the Santa Fe Institute, Wall Street venture capitalists, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on people such as developers, managers, and investors sheds light on the messy process of software development—a negotiation between individuals, their aspirations and worldviews, and shape-shifting technologies. Springing forth from this mess came &lt;i&gt;The Sims&lt;/i&gt;, which required an extraordinary amount of research and development. But this same mess also thwarted Maxis’s solvency and its attempts to bring &lt;i&gt;The Sims&lt;/i&gt; to market. Ultimately, we’ll see how &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;, Maxis, and &lt;i&gt;The Sims&lt;/i&gt;—like games, play, and software more generally—reflect their time and place, and the people who make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chaim Gingold &lt;/b&gt;is the author of &lt;i&gt;Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine&lt;/i&gt; (MIT Press), which Stewart Brand called "one of the best origin stories ever told and the best account I've seen of how innovation actually occurs in computerdom.”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Gingold began his design career apprenticed to Will Wright on &lt;i&gt;Spore&lt;/i&gt;, where his chief accomplishment was designing the critically acclaimed&lt;i&gt; Spore Creature Creator. &lt;/i&gt;His projects, like &lt;i&gt;Earth: A Primer&lt;/i&gt;, a science book made of interactive toys, have been featured by &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CNN&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;New York Times.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
