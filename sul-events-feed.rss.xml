      <title>Paper Trails: The Art of Processing Archival Collections at Green Library, East Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every archival collection that Stanford Libraries acquires must be processed before it can be made available for research. The expertise, thought, and care that goes into processing archival collections often occurs behind-the-scenes. Using the John Perry Barlow papers as a throughline, this exhibit explores the art of processing archival collections. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Planet.com Demo at Mitchell Earth Sciences</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Planet is the leader in the current "small sat" revolution in Earth imaging. With a growing constellation of 200+ "Doves," Planet is able to image the Earth's landmass at 3m pixel resolution, once every day. This high cadence, medium-high resolution imagery is well suited to monitoring applications, semantic segmentation and traditional remote sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stanford Geospatial Center's Stace Maples will provide a high level overview of the Planetscope data subscription, including how to search for and access the data available to Stanford Researchers, through the Stanford University Library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Overreach and Overreaction: The Downward Spiral in the U.S.-China Relations at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are pleased to present the &lt;strong&gt;2022 Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh Memorial Lecture&lt;/strong&gt; featuring &lt;strong&gt;Professor Susan Shirk &lt;/strong&gt;who will be speaking on &lt;em&gt;Overreach and Overreaction: The Downward Spiral in the U.S.-China Relations.  &lt;/em&gt;This is an in-person event.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Why did China abandon its successful foreign policy of restraint and shift toward confrontation and unchecked control over its own society? Surprisingly the shift began under Hu Jintao's collective leadership (2002-12). Under the personalistic leadership of Xi Jinping the trend has intensified. Those who implement Xi's directives compete to outdo one another, provoking an even greater global backlash. To counter China's overreach, the worst mistake the rest of the world, and the United States in particular, can make is to overreact. Understanding the domestic political drivers of foreign policy in both countries can help us stem the downward spiral in relations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://china.ucsd.edu/scholars/shirk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susan Shirk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is Chair of the 21st Century China Center and research professor at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy. Shirk's book, &lt;em&gt;China:  Fragile Superpower&lt;/em&gt; helped frame the policy debate on China in the U.S. and other countries. Her articles have appeared in leading academic publications in political science, international relations, and China studies. She previously served as deputy assistant secretary of state (1997-2000) responsible for U.S. policy toward China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mongolia. She is director emeritus of the UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation and founded the Northeast Asia Cooperation Dialogue, an unofficial forum for discussion of security issues. Shirk is a graduate of Mt. Holyoke College and received her PhD from M.I.T.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The family of &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh&lt;/strong&gt; donated his personal archive to the Stanford Libraries' Special Collections and endowed the Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh Memorial Lecture series to honor his legacy and to inspire future generations. Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh (1919-2004) was former Governor of the Central Bank in Taiwan. During his tenure, he was responsible for the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, and was widely recognized for achieving stability and economic growth. In his long and distinguished career as economist and development specialist, he held key positions in multilateral institutions including the Asian Development Bank, where as founding Director, he was instrumental in advancing the green revolution and in the transformation of rural Asia. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/projects/hsieh-lecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Read more about Dr. Hsieh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Panel Disussion: New book release, "Comrade Sisters: Women of the Black Panther Party" at Green Library, East Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of us have heard these three words: Black Panther Party.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some know the Party's history as a movement for the social, political, economic, and spiritual upliftment of Black and indigenous people of color – but to this day, few know the story of the backbone of the Party: the women. It's estimated that six out of ten Panther Party members were women. While these remarkable women of all ages and diverse backgrounds were regularly making headlines agitating, protesting, and organizing, these same women were building communities and enacting social justice, providing food, housing, education, healthcare, and more to the people. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.marcusbooks.com/book/9781788841757" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Comrade Sisters&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is their story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Please join Stanford Libraries as we host what is sure to be an exciting discussion featuring co-authors Stephen Shames and Ericka Huggins of the newly released book, &lt;a href="https://www.marcusbooks.com/book/9781788841757" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comrade Sisters: Women of the Black Panther Party&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Shames and Ms. Huggins will be joined by two other former Black Panther Party members for the discussion, which will take place in Green Library's Hohbach Hall presentation room.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The panel discussion will begin at 4:30 pm following the &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/justice_equity_diversity_and_inclusion_jedi_fair_8413" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion) Fair&lt;/a&gt;, (2 – 4 pm).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Book sales and signing will follow outside of Green Library on the patio nearest Coupa Café.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__________&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ericka Huggins&lt;/strong&gt; is an activist, former political prisoner, and leader in the Black Panther Party. She has devoted her life to the equitable treatment of all human beings, beyond the boundaries of race, age, culture, class, gender, sexual orientation, ability, and status associated with citizenship. For the past 40 years, she has lectured across the country and internationally. She spent 14 years in the Black Panther Party, and eight years as Director of the renowned Oakland Community School (1973-1981).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen Shames &lt;/strong&gt;has authored 15 monographs, and his images are in the permanent collections of 40 museums and foundations. His work is dedicated to promoting social change and sharing the stories of those who are frequently overlooked by society. His two previous Panther books are Power to the People: The World of the Black Panthers by Stephen Shames and Bobby Seale (Abrams,2016) and The Black Panthers (Aperture, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M. Gayle Asali Dickson&lt;/strong&gt; is an ordained minister and served as Pastor of the South Berkeley Congregational Church (SBCC), United Church of Christ, in Berkeley, CA from 1998 to 2006.

She also served as a preschool teacher at its Oakland Community School using art as a tool to teach cognitive skills to preschoolers.
