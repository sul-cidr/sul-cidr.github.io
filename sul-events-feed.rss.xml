      <title>Rise Up for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders exhibit</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the precipitous increase in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) hate crimes throughout the United States, the staff of Stanford Libraries created the Rise Up against AAPI exhibit which focuses on the history of systemic racism against the AAPI community. The aim of this exhibit is to help educate our community and provide support and resources so that we can start the process of healing and prevent future incidents. In this exhibit, we discuss past events that have led to these reprehensible acts, including institutionalized policies that have pitted minority groups in our country against each other to weaken the other&amp;#8217;s influence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We hope that through education, our community at large can rise to action against racism at all levels of our society. From the nuanced exclusions on the playground and in the workplace, to the blatant disregard for human life demonstrated in the murders of Asian American women in Atlanta and the brutal attacks on elderly AAPI community members in California and New York&amp;#8212;we must all take an active stand against the scourge that racism is to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This exhibit has both an online and physical presence. You can access the online exhibit at &lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/riseup" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exhibits.stanford.edu/riseup&lt;/a&gt;. The physical exhibit is in the East Asia Library and is a companion to the online exhibit. The physical exhibit highlights material from the Stanford Libraries collection and other sources that illustrate the racial struggle of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community throughout US history. Please note the physical exhibit is only open during the East Asia Library's open hours. Visit &lt;a href="https://library-hours.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;library.stanford.edu/hours&lt;/a&gt; to see current hours.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This exhibit is a work in progress and just the beginning of our efforts to combat racism in this country. Look for expanded content covering more ethnic groups and a broader range of issues as this exhibit continues to grow over the fall 2021 quarter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries stands with the AAPI community and denounces all hate crimes, including the recent surge in hate crimes specifically targeted at the AAPI community. We hope you will join our efforts to learn about the history of violence against the AAPI community so that we can prevent history from repeating itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Say Their Names - No More Names</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Say Their Names &amp;ndash; No More Names&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an online and in-person exhibit that highlights Black Americans who have been killed or impacted by police brutality and systemic racism. The exhibit originated in direct response to the global Black Lives Matter movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical exhibition in Green Library includes names affixed to glass panels in the Bing Wing as well as banners throughout the first floor that contain the names and faces of the featured victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/saytheirnames" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online exhibit&lt;/a&gt; displays the images and individual stories of victims, including Emmett Till, Kalief Browder, Salecia Johnson and Bettie Jones; it also calls attention to events like the Tulsa riots, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the Chicago Police Department Midnight Crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who visit Stanford can also see a large banner featuring the words &amp;#39;Know Justice Know Peace,&amp;#39; which was hung on the front entrance of Green Library commemorating the opening of the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note the physical exhibit in Green Library is currently limited to authorized Stanford ID cardholders due to COVID-19.&amp;nbsp; However, the online exhibit, which also includes photos of the physical exhibit is available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibit is sponsored by the Stanford Libraries and is a follow up to a &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/node/171904" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement of solidarity and support&lt;/a&gt; against systemic racism published by Stanford Libraries over the summer. It offers opportunities for learning, reflection and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Health &amp; Wellbeing Panel Qualitative Methods with Dr. Patricia Rodriguez Espinosa &amp; Charles Varner.</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featured event: &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/projects/gear-research/winter-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gear Up for Social Science Data 2022 &lt;/a&gt;Program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join &lt;/strong&gt;Stanford's Qualitative Data Librarian, Alesia Montgomery as she leads a discussion on methods and collaboration with Stanford researchers about their recent projects on Health &amp; Wellbeing: reflections &amp; lessons for qualitative research collaborations across language and culture with Dr. Espinosa (Stanford Medicine) and The American Voices Project with Charles Varner (Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Patricia Rodriguez Espinosa &lt;/strong&gt;will reflect on lessons for qualitative research collaborations across language and culture, noting that qualitative scholars are increasingly engaged in global research where members of the research team are from different countries and cultures and have different primary languages. However, in-depth descriptions of how to rigorously work as a transnational team are scarce. Using a collaboration between Stanford and Chulalongkorn University in Thailand as a case example, the following presentation will showcase nuances and challenges experienced in this research collaboration, and the strategies employed to optimize the validity and reliability of the study findings. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Varner o&lt;/strong&gt;f the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality will speak about the use of qualitative methods in the research by the American Voices Project. The American Voices Project (AVP) relies on immersive interviews to deliver a comprehensive portrait of life across the country. The interview protocol blends qualitative, survey, administrative, and experimental approaches to collecting data on such topics as family, living situations, community, health, emotional well-being, living costs, and income.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panelist &amp; Moderator Bios:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Patricia Rodriguez Espinosa&lt;/strong&gt; is an instructor in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health and the Associate Director of Research for the Office of Community Engagement at Stanford University School of Medicine. The ultimate goal of her research is to decrease health inequities among racial/ethnic minority populations through transdisciplinary and community-engaged scholarship. Her research aims to understand factors that create and maintain health inequities and use these insights to develop novel multi-level interventions and health promotion programs to address the inequity gap and that include multi-sectoral collaborations. Dr. Rodriguez Espinosa's research has also centered around developing the science of community-based participatory research, citizen science, and other participatory research approaches.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Varner&lt;/strong&gt;, Associate Director of the Center on Poverty and Inequality, leads the CPI's research, training, and administrative data programs and is senior editor of Pathways Magazine. Author of influential tax-return studies of "millionaire migration," he is a scholar of the demographic, social, and political sources of poverty and inequality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alesia Montgomery &lt;/strong&gt;is the liaison for the Sociology and Psychology Departments. She consults and collaborates with qualitative researchers campus-wide (see her topic guide on &lt;a href="https://guides.library.stanford.edu/qualitative_research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;qualitative research&lt;/a&gt;). Montgomery is also an urban ethnographer, and teaches in Stanford's Urban Studies Program. Her recent book is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13571958" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Greening the Black Urban Regime: The Culture and Commerce of Sustainability in Detroit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Andres Sutt, Minister of Entrepreneurship and IT of Estonia at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with Andres Sutt, Minister of Entrepreneurship and Information Technology of the Republic of Estonia, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;who will discuss:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Future of AI Society&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia has long been at the forefront of digital innovation in government. In 2020, Estonia joined the UN Security Council for the first time. As an elected member, it has been at the center of crisis diplomacy, keeping the focus on violations of international law and supporting international justice. Estonia was the first one to bring the topic of cybersecurity to the Security Council and has kept the security issues of its region in the global focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI), government e-solutions, and (cyber)security are immediate and pressing challenges a modern state has to tackle, especially during the current security crisis in Europe, caused by Russia&amp;#39;s war against Ukraine and Putin&amp;#39;s escalating rhetoric. Our goal has been, and continues to be, to raise awareness on the international level of emerging threats, including in cyberspace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The conversation will be facilitated by &lt;a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/andrew-j-grotto" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Grotto,&lt;/a&gt; Director of Program on Geopolitics, Technology, and Governance, Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.valitsus.ee/en/prime-minister-ministers/minister-entrepreneurship-and-information-technology-andres-sutt" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mr. Andres Sutt&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of Entrepreneurship and Information Technology of the Republic of Estonia since 26 January 2021, is a member of the liberal Reform Party. He has over 25 years of international experience in central banking, bank restructuring, and crisis management. Mr. Sutt was the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Estonia, worked for the European Financial Stability Facility, and represented Estonia at the Executive Board of the IMF. Mr.&amp;nbsp; Sutt has a Master&amp;#39;s Degree in Economics and Finance (cum laude) from Tartu University and has studied management at INSEAD, France. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;He serves as the Board Member of SOS Children&amp;#39;s Village Estonia, Estonian Maternity Hospitals Foundation, and the University of Tartu Foundation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Admission Info&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public. Seating is extremely limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All attendees must be vaccinated and adhere to Stanford&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://healthalerts.stanford.edu/covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;health policies&lt;/a&gt;. Non-Stanford guests must complete the &lt;a href="https://redcap.stanford.edu/surveys/?s=TMJAC9X3JM" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;health attestation form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Designing Radically Inclusive Solutions Exhibition at Green Library, Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Intersectional design drives innovation while supporting social justice and environmetnal sustainability. It's about getting the design right for people across all of soceity -- from the very beginning. This exhibit takes visitors through the &lt;em&gt;Intersectional Design Cards&lt;/em&gt;, a design activity to create radically inclusive products, processes, and paradigms that was developed by an interdisciplinary team from Stanford University's Hasso Plattner Instiute of Design (the d.school). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This exhibition is free and open to active Stanford ID cardholders during Green Library's operating hours. Face coverings are strongly recommended.
