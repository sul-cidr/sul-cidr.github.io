          &lt;div class="stanford-events-date"&gt;Date: Ongoing every day from September 4, 2020 through January 31, 2022.  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="stanford-events-location"&gt;Location: Green Library and online&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="stanford-events-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Say Their Names – No More Names&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an online and in-person exhibit that highlights Black Americans who have been killed or impacted by police brutality and systemic racism. The exhibit originated in direct response to the global Black Lives Matter movement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The physical exhibition in Green Library includes names affixed to glass panels in the Bing Wing as well as banners throughout the first floor that contain the names and faces of the featured victims.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/saytheirnames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;online exhibit&lt;/a&gt; displays the images and individual stories of victims, including Emmett Till, Kalief Browder, Salecia Johnson and Bettie Jones; it also calls attention to events like the Tulsa riots, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the Chicago Police Department Midnight Crew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Those who visit Stanford can also see a large banner featuring the words "Know Justice Know Peace," which was hung on the front entrance of Green Library commemorating the opening of the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Please note the physical exhibit in Green Library is currently limited to authorized Stanford ID cardholders due to COVID-19.  However, the online exhibit, which also includes photos of the physical exhibit is available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibit is sponsored by the Stanford Libraries and is a follow up to a &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/node/171904" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;statement of solidarity and support&lt;/a&gt; against systemic racism published by Stanford Libraries over the summer. It offers opportunities for learning, reflection and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

         <title>Rise Up for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders exhibit</title>
         <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/924/92483</link>
         <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/924/92483</guid>
         <description>
          &lt;div class="stanford-events-date"&gt;Date: Ongoing every day from September 20, 2021 through June 30, 2022.  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="stanford-events-location"&gt;Location: Online and in the East Asia Library&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="stanford-events-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the precipitous increase in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) hate crimes throughout the United States, the staff of Stanford Libraries created the Rise Up against AAPI exhibit which focuses on the history of systemic racism against the AAPI community. The aim of this exhibit is to help educate our community and provide support and resources so that we can start the process of healing and prevent future incidents. In this exhibit, we discuss past events that have led to these reprehensible acts, including institutionalized policies that have pitted minority groups in our country against each other to weaken the other’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that through education, our community at large can rise to action against racism at all levels of our society. From the nuanced exclusions on the playground and in the workplace, to the blatant disregard for human life demonstrated in the murders of Asian American women in Atlanta and the brutal attacks on elderly AAPI community members in California and New York—we must all take an active stand against the scourge that racism is to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibit has both an online and physical presence. You can access the online exhibit at &lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/riseup" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exhibits.stanford.edu/riseup&lt;/a&gt;. The physical exhibit is in the East Asia Library and is a companion to the online exhibit. The physical exhibit highlights material from the Stanford Libraries collection and other sources that illustrate the racial struggle of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community throughout US history. Please note the physical exhibit is only open during the East Asia Library's open hours. Visit &lt;a href="https://library-hours.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;library.stanford.edu/hours&lt;/a&gt; to see current hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is a work in progress and just the beginning of our efforts to combat racism in this country. Look for expanded content covering more ethnic groups and a broader range of issues as this exhibit continues to grow over the fall 2021 quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries stands with the AAPI community and denounces all hate crimes, including the recent surge in hate crimes specifically targeted at the AAPI community. We hope you will join our efforts to learn about the history of violence against the AAPI community so that we can prevent history from repeating itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

         <title>Precession: R. Buckminster Fuller's Creative Connections</title>
         <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/924/92480</link>
         <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/924/92480</guid>

          &lt;div class="stanford-events-date"&gt;Date: Ongoing  from October 7, 2021 through January 3, 2022.  See details for exact dates and times.  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="stanford-events-location"&gt;Location: Green Library Bing Wing, 2nd Floor&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="stanford-events-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/spc/current-exhibits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exhibition to show October 7, 2021 — January 3, 2022, in Cecil H. Green Library &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Precession: The effect of bodies in motion on other bodies in motion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the inner effects of all, or most bodies in motion, and all other bodies in motion in [the] Universe is all "precessional." So I hope that instead of this just being a word that seems remote to you now, it suddenly begins to be important.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;-R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;em&gt;Precession: R. Buckminster Fuller’s Creative Connections&lt;/em&gt;, on view October 7, 2021, through January 3, 2022, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library Bing Wing. Fuller is perhaps best known as the patent-holder of the geodesic dome. Yet his projects were quite varied and touched upon many principles of creative scientific inquiry. The exhibition celebrates the creative connections between R. Buckminster Fuller and his contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, Stanford University Libraries acquired the archive of R. Buckminster Fuller, currently our largest single manuscript collection with over 1300 linear feet of papers and numerous recordings and models spanning the years 1920—1983. This massive collection has brought new insights about Fuller to light and illuminated key relationships with Fuller and other creative thinkers across the course of his multifaceted career as a mathematician, professor, and public intellectual. More than just acquaintances, these meetings of minds created what Fuller might have called “precessional” effects, with each exerting incremental influences on one another’s paths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Fuller had hundreds of friendships, professional relationships, and collaborators throughout his life, which he maintained through travel as well as copious correspondence. This exhibit focuses on just a handful of the many well-documented relationships within the Fuller Collection and other manuscript collections at Stanford University Libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with the exhibition’s opening, a virtual &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/spc/current-exhibits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Panel Discussion: R. Buckminster Fuller’s Creative Connections&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by the Department of Special Collections and Stanford Libraries, will occur online on October 14th, 2021, from 4:00 pm - 5:00 pm PT. This event is free and open to the public; &lt;a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_VtdxQ1vyRN-CSEHLTeaq3Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;registration is required&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: In addition to the physical exhibition, there is a forthcoming online exhibition; stay tuned to the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/spc/current-exhibits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Current&lt;/a&gt; Exhibits page for updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fuller's Creative Connections&lt;/em&gt; will be on display in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda exhibit cases from October 7, 2021—January 3, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Library Hours page &lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is free and currently restricted to the following current Stanford ID cardholders: students, post-docs, professors (including emeriti), academic staff, fellows, and Stanford visiting scholars. Learn about the Libraries' &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/status" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;entry requirements and available services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

         <title>Stacy Levy: Revealing Nature: Art Translates Ecology</title>
         <link>http://events.stanford.edu/events/932/93223</link>
         <guid>http://events.stanford.edu/events/932/93223</guid>

          &lt;div class="stanford-events-date"&gt;Date: Wednesday, November 17, 2021.  10:00 AM.&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="stanford-events-location"&gt;Location: Zoom Webinar&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="stanford-events-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can art create ecological legibility and give us an understanding of the natural world in our backyards, parks and urban spaces? Art can create a new modality for comprehending nature— different from science, which has been the traditional translator of nature. This new take on ecology can be more experiential and show change over time. Art has the power to capture nature at all its scales: from the microscopic diatom to the vast weather patterns and to invite people to see and sense and learn about the ways they are connected to the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stacylevy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://www.stacylevy.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Join us for an engaging talk from Stacy Levy, in celebration of GISDay@Stanford. Stacy will discuss the motivation and process for creating her architectural-scale sculptural geographic installations &amp; "physicalizations" of spatial information and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
