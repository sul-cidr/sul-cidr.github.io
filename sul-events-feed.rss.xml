      <title>Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the essence, and the form fades away at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;청계 차일수: 득의망상 (得意忘象)&lt;br&gt;
Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the Essence, and the Form Fades Away&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stanford East Asia Library presents an exhibition by the South Korean artist Cheonggea Ilsu Cha from November 18, 2024 to February 20, 2025. Artist Cha has dedicated his 40-year career to the mastery of ‘literati’ painting.  The literati genre combines written word with a painterly interpretation of text, a form of art that has been practiced by the scholarly elite in Korea for over 400 years. His work has been featured at the prestigious Grand Art Exhibition of Korea, and he has held eight solo exhibitions.&lt;br&gt;
A significant number of Korean scholars practiced literati painting during the Joseon Dynasty, which extended from 1392 to 1897. Literati painting reflects the scholar’s observation, understanding and interpretation of a poetic topic. The artist strives for aesthetic discipline; the text must be no longer than what the topic minimally requires. So too must the artist seek simplicity in his visual vocabulary.  The exhibition is inspired by the philosophy of Tŭgŭi mangsang (得意忘象), which emphasizes abandoning artifice in order to seek the true nature of things.  The works at the exhibition employ the use of ink and a constrained palette of color using materials such as traditional Korean paper, scrolls, and fans. The paintings touch on a wide variety of topics, from nature to philosophical reflections to expressions of human emotion. Cha’s work is inspired by the artistic sensibility of his predecessors. Visitors to the museum will find paintings imbued with a classic aesthetic, timeless charm, and a lively wit.&lt;br&gt;
This exhibition of Cha’s Korean literati paintings was curated by Jee-Young Park, Korean Studies Librarian at Stanford East Asia Library; Ji Soo Kim, M.A. in  Museum Studies from San Francisco State University; and Wooju Chong, M. A. in Center for East Asian Studies from Stanford University, in consultation with the East Asia Library Exhibits Committee.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: Authenticity by Design at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet is at an inflection point. With the growth of artificial intelligence and synthetic media, trust in information faces unprecedented threats. Authenticity is not guaranteed. At the same time, new technologies–referred to as “Web 3”–present opportunities to protect the integrity of data. These solutions can be applied to critical practices including investigative journalism, historical archiving, and the admissibility of legal evidence. This exhibit, curated by the &lt;a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/"&gt;Starling Lab for Data Integrity&lt;/a&gt;, asks: How might we design information systems for authenticity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/visitor-access" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep Learning Based Framework to Identify Undocumented Orphaned Oil and Gas Wells from Historical Maps (Bay Area Open Science Group Meeting)</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month, the Bay Area Open Science Group will be joined by Dr. Fabio Ciulla, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Climate and Ecosystem Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He earned his M.S. degrees in Physics from the University of Rome La Sapienza and completed his Ph.D. at Northeastern University in Boston, focusing on nonlinear dynamics of diffusive phenomena on geographical networks. At Berkeley Lab, his research includes developing data-driven models to predict water quality and leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to detect undocumented legacy oil and gas wells across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undocumented Orphaned Wells (UOWs) in the U.S. pose environmental risks, including methane leaks and groundwater contamination. This study used historical topographic maps, available as open-source data from USGS, and a U-Net computer vision model to detect well symbols in the maps and flag UOWs when there is no match among known wells. Applied to areas in California and Oklahoma, it revealed 1,301 potential UOWs with high spatial accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Bay Area Open Science Group&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Bay Area Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area (and more!) academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning. Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epicenters: Navigating Recovery and Renewal from Disasters at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;In the wake of disaster, maps play many roles, shaping understanding of the event in the immediate aftermath, serving as visceral portrayals for those who were not there, and communicating both scale and extent of the tragedy. They gavanize support for rebuilding by showing new possible futures and can be used to memorialize the event, inscribing the memory over the landscape. Drawing upon sources from historical representations to contemporary satellite imagery, the maps in this exhibition explore various ways communities use maps to make sense of calamity and move forward from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;The exhibition was curated by Stanford student Muhammad Dhafer, winner of the 2024 California Map Society student exhibition competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This exhibition is ongoing and will be available until February 28th, 2024. To view the exhibit, visit the David Rumsey Map Center during its public drop-in hours.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Canceled: European Security in a New Transatlantic Era: A Conversation with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia Margus Tsahkna and Prof. Michael McFaul at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia Margus Tsahkna and Director of the Freeman Spogli Institute Michael McFaul on Russia’s war against Ukraine, its global implications, and transatlantic collaboration:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;European Security in a New Transatlantic Era&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minister Tsahkna will present Estonia’s take on strengthening transatlantic cooperation in the increasingly interconnected world. The only way to tackle current global geopolitical challenges is for the transatlantic partnership to remain strong and effective. There is much to gain from working together on both sides of the Atlantic in economic, security, or energy-related areas. The Minister will touch upon respective ongoing discussions in Estonia, but also the European Union and NATO, especially in reaction to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Achieving just and lasting peace in Ukraine, with a clear path for the country into the EU and NATO, remains not only the key issue for European security but will have a broader positive impact globally. Protecting international law, advancing the rules-based international order, countering hybrid attacks, and supporting those who fight for their sovereignty and freedom are all complex tasks that require the highest degree of cooperation and unity between partners who share the same fundamental values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Margus Tsahkna&lt;/b&gt; is the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Estonia from 17 April 2023. He is a member of the Eesti 200 party. Previously, Mr. Tsahkna served as a long-time member of the Estonian Parliament. He also served as Minister of Defence (2016–2017) and Minister of Social Protection (2015–2016). He studied at the School of Theology and Religious Studies and the School of Law at the University of Tartu from 1996–2002 and at the University of Toronto from 1999–2000, specializing in international law.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael McFaul&lt;/b&gt; is the Director at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, the Ken Olivier and Angela Nomellini Professor of International Studies in the Department of Political Science, and the Peter and Helen Bing Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1995. He served for five years in the Obama administration, first as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs at the National Security Council at the White House (2009-2012), and then as U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation (2012-2014).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Opening remarks will be delivered by &lt;b&gt;Michael Keller&lt;/b&gt;, Vice Provost and University Librarian.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This in-person event is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/ciJUscMuehXWDxwbA"&gt;Registration is required.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Erik Baker, "Make Your Own Job: How the Entrepreneurial Work Ethic Exhausted America"  at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming Erik Baker as he discusses &lt;i&gt;Make Your Own Job: How the Entreprenerial Work Ethic Exhausted America &lt;/i&gt;on Freburary 6, 2025. &lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674293601"&gt;A copy of the book can be purcahsed here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Americans think about work changed profoundly over the course of the twentieth century. Thrift and persistence came to seem old-fashioned. Successful workers were increasingly expected to show initiative and enthusiasm for change—not just to do their jobs reliably but to create new opportunities for themselves and for others. Our culture of work today is more demanding than ever, even though workers haven't seen commensurate rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make Your Own Job&lt;/i&gt; explains how this entrepreneurial work ethic took hold, from its origins in late nineteenth-century success literature to the gig economy of today, sweeping in strange bedfellows: Marcus Garvey and Henry Ford, Avon ladies and New Age hippies. Business schools and consultants exhorted managers to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit in their subordinates, while an industry of self-help authors synthesized new ideas from psychology into a vision of work as “self-realization.” Policy experts embraced the new ethic as a remedy for urban and Third World poverty. Every social group and political tendency, it seems, has had its own exemplary entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historian Erik Baker argues that the entrepreneurial work ethic has given meaning to work in a world where employment is ever more precarious––and in doing so, has helped legitimize a society of mounting economic insecurity and inequality. From the advent of corporate capitalism in the Gilded Age to the economic stagnation of recent decades, Americans have become accustomed to the reality that today’s job may be gone tomorrow. Where work is hard to find and older nostrums about diligent effort fall flat, the advice to “make your own job” keeps hope alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik Baker &lt;/b&gt;is a lecturer in the History of Science Department and the director of the senior thesis program for the History &amp;amp; Science concentration. He received his PhD from Harvard and his BA from Northwestern University. His book project, &lt;i&gt;Make Your Own Job: The Entrepreneurial Work Ethic in Modern America&lt;/i&gt;, explores the role of popular psychologists and management experts in transforming beliefs about work and success in the twentieth-century United States. He has published on the history of social science and American capitalism in Modern Intellectual History, History of the Human Sciences, and Studies in History and Philosophy of Science. He also writes widely for magazines such as &lt;i&gt;n+1, The Baffler, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thedriftmag.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Drift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, where he is an associate editor.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Love Data Week 2025 BioBlitz</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This workshop is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/"&gt;a series of workshops for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating and Using Biodiversity Big Data is a multipart activity that begins with a virtual workshop on locating, downloading, and cleaning biodiversity data for research. Following the workshop, participants will be invited to join an asynchronous &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/stanford-love-data-week-2025-bioblitz"&gt;Bioblitz&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/"&gt;iNaturalist platform&lt;/a&gt; to generate biodiversity data that will be shared with the open data repository GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). Participants will learn how to search for data of interest, learn about some of the caveats of using biodiversity big data, how to clean and properly attribute data, and will also contribute data themselves by participating in a week-long Bioblitz across Stanford campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monday, February 10, 1-2:30pm PT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wikidata Edit-a-thon at IC Classroom, Green Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of  &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/"&gt;a series of workshops for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wikidata.org/"&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt; is an open, multilingual structured knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines and is made by people like you. Digital assistants like &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q582159"&gt;Siri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28022144"&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; use Wikidata, as do search engines like &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9366"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. You can think of Wikidata as a database of databases, linking items through identifiers. This creates a centralized location of information about anything and everything: from the &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184067"&gt;pika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3141050"&gt;Chicago-style hot dog&lt;/a&gt;. With over &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:Statistics"&gt;114,683,910&lt;/a&gt; data &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Help:Items"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, there’s likely to be an item for your favorite band, and your birthplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Join us online and in person for an introduction to Wikidata followed by a Wikidata Edit-a-thon! Learn more about Wikidata’s impact, how to make edits, create references, and query Wikidata in this 2-hour hands-on session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuesday, February 11, 1am – 1pm &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In-person, IC Classroom, Green Library and on Zoom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://goto.stanford.edu/wikidata"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Register for Event&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;goto.stanford.edu/wikidata. &lt;/b&gt;Spots are open to current Stanford Affiliates only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount"&gt;create an account&lt;/a&gt; in advance, and enroll in the &lt;a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/Stanford_University/LDW_Wikidata_Edit-a-thon?enroll=yugnhepj"&gt;Edit-a-thon Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; to track our edits during Love Data Week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For those attending the in-person workshop, please bring your Stanford ID card/mobile ID to enter the library. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>California Pop-up Exhibit @ Branner Earth Sciences Library at Mitchell Earth Sciences</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Stanford Libraries pop-up exhibits on &lt;b&gt;California&lt;/b&gt;, Branner Earth Sciences Library &amp;amp; Map Collections will be featuring maps, reports, and minerals created as part of the&lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/sgs-collection"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Stanford Geological Survey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, February 13, 2025 from 1-3pm in Branner Library (2nd Floor, Mitchell Earth Sciences Building). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On display will be several items including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/7594435"&gt;Herbert Hoover's student topographic map of the Stanford campus created c. 1893.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5968665"&gt;Report and map by Mary Balch Kennedy (1929)&lt;/a&gt; who was not allowed to attend the required Summer Geology Camp because she was a woman, instead she had to map the geology of the New Almaden Quadrangle alone in rugged terrain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/4793992"&gt;R.B. Marshall's map (1895) covering a large amount, if not all, of the Stanford lands&lt;/a&gt;.  He notes the "marsh line" which extended to present day HIghway 101 as a dotted line across the top section of the map. This may be the only map from this time depicting the marshlands with such detail at this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will also feature several minerals from the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability Specimen Collection, collected during the surveys or in surveyed areas, including Epidote, Gold, Jade, Actinolite, and Quartz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.sites.stanford.edu/"&gt;Love Data Week at Stanford&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A current Stanford ID is needed to enter the library, visitors must present a government issued ID card to sign-in at the front desk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using LLMs to Extract Structured Data from PDFs at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This workshop is part of Stanford's &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Love Data Week 2025&lt;/a&gt;. The topic is the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract structured data from PDFs or other data. Imagine that you have a PDF with some tabular data in it, like a table. You want that data to work in a computable form (like CSV) for use in Excel or other tools. Large language models (LLMs) might be able to help with this task. &lt;a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/service/aiplayground" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;The Stanford AI Playground&lt;/a&gt; provides an easy mechanism to experiment with LLMs to help with data extraction or manipulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please register &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lPtEvL8wRO6HHYCLkHAXKAdqdtTe54F6i9-qR9aGWnw/viewform?edit_requested=true"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your spot for this workshop!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Location: &lt;a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/j/99304416100?pwd=maeD4Xg4fV7kozrfNg0MXQ71sRI7FK.1"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; and Velma Denning Room (120F), Green Library&lt;br&gt;
Date and Time: 1:00PM to 2:00PM PT on Thursday, February 13, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instructor:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Peter Mangiafico (Product Manager and Software Engineer, Digital Library Systems and Services)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabletop Tuesdays: Studying Data with the game Rescue Polar Bears: Data &amp; Temperature at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month's Tabletop Tuesdays is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;a series for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rescue Polar Bears: Data &amp;amp; Temperature is a cooperative game based on Rescue Polar Bears with a new data and temperature system added to the game design to make the strategy more diversified. The consumption of fossil fuel and releasing of greenhouse gases yield the global warming. Around the North Pole, the last icebergs are melting and the polar bears are facing the risk of being extinct. The players form a scientific organization. They try to collect data about climate change to persuade the governments to change their energy policy. At the same time, they also need to prevent polar bears from sinking into the freezing water. Each player drives a rescue ship of different ability to complete the mission on the Arctic Ocean. As long as the players collectively gather enough data, they win together. However, if too many polar bears sink into the water, everyone loses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabletop Tuesdays is an event series held on the third Tuesday of each month. At these events, we feature a selection of board games and collection items from across SUL's holdings around a specific theme. Drop in to learn about the month's featured game(s) and/or try some of the board games we have for open play at the Silicon Valley Archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ART/WORK at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VSx6TzALj_SsUn3VAvXzZpCNMpFJoLya/view?usp=sharing"&gt;ART/WORK | Creative Pursuits of Stanford Libraries Staff&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; on view February 20, 2024, through April 27, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this exhibition, we sought to create a space where staff could share their artistic, creative sides that may not otherwise be a part of their work at Stanford. In the Summer of 2024, Special Collections invited current Stanford Libraries staff to enter creative work in any medium to be considered for a Winter 2025 exhibit in Green Library’s Peterson Gallery and Rotunda. Response to the call for entries was hearty. In addition to traditional fine art techniques of drawing, painting, printmaking, and photography, submissions included mixed media sculpture, ceramics, collage, textiles, and poetry. An anonymous selection committee of library staff blind-reviewed over a hundred entries and chose the fifty works displayed in the galleries. We asked the people whose pieces were selected to write a brief statement to accompany their work in the exhibit and posed several questions for their consideration: Why do creative work? What medium do you work in and why? How did you get started? What does it mean to you to be an artist (if you define yourself as one)? Does art need an audience? Who is your audience? What influences your work, and whose work do you admire? As you will see, Stanford library staff are talented and thoughtful, pursuing many forms of creative work after hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Roberto Trujillo, Associate University Librarian, Director of Special Collections and Frances and Charles Field Curator of Special Collections; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions, with assistance from Elizabeth Fischbach.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their careful consideration of all staff art submissions, we thank the staff members who served on the jury; For their assessment of materials, Aisha Wahab and Beth Ryan in Conservation Services; For their assistance with logistics Ranelle Sharma and Jacob Cohn in Library Facilities, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Library Hours page &lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;
