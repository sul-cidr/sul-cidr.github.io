      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: Authenticity by Design at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet is at an inflection point. With the growth of mis/disinformation, artificial intelligence and synthetic media, trust in information faces unprecedented threats. Authenticity is not guaranteed. At the same time, new technologies–referred to as “Web 3”–present opportunities to protect the integrity of data. These solutions can be applied to critical practices including investigative journalism, historical archiving, and the admissibility of legal evidence. This exhibit, curated by the &lt;a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/"&gt;Starling Lab for Data Integrity&lt;/a&gt;, asks: How might we design information systems for authenticity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/visitor-access" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SCRABrraaNNG! The Explosion of Futurist Poetry at McMurtry Building</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;Bowes Library’s Autumn 2024 exhibition, &lt;i&gt;SCRABrrRrraaNNG! The Explosion of&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Futurist Poetry&lt;/i&gt;, explores the unique history of Italian Futurist poetry during its first period (1909-1918). Futurism, founded by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1909, was a leading avant-garde movement in Europe that rejected history and tradition in the name of technology, dynamism, and violence. In 1912, Marinetti declared war on his Symbolist predecessors, inventing a new form of poetics that tested the limits of typography and aimed to shock readers with obliterated syntax, onomatopoeias, and word-images. On display are featured items from Bowes and Green Libraries' Special Collections, as well as the Futurist Archive's private collection, including Marinetti's seminal work of "words-in-freedom,"&lt;i&gt;Zang&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Tumb Tuuum&lt;/i&gt; (1914), and several first editions by other Futurist poets. Curated by Ty Davidian, PhD Candidate in Italian. Sponsored by the Department of French and Italian and the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;Library hours: M-Th 9-7pm, Friday 9-5pm, Sunday 12-6pm. Opening reception Oct. 10, 4-6pm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New Deal &amp; The Federal Writers' Project at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-UT_h28D9ylo9I3qEOfJJXmbaL_Ol8wq4VIw_k6PEU4/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New Deal &amp;amp; The Federal Writers' Project | Selections from the Bruce and Rachel Jeffer Collection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on view May 6, 2024, through January 26, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by childhood automobile trips across the U.S. with his father and a lifelong love of American history and literature, Los Angeles attorney Bruce Jeffer assembled a magnificent collection—totaling nearly two thousand titles—of the Federal Writers’ Project and related WPA and New Deal publications. He and his wife Rachel gifted it to the Stanford Libraries Department of Special Collections in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created as a New Deal program within the Works Progress Administration in 1935, the Federal Writers’ Project (Federal Writers’ Program 1939–1943) employed as many as six thousand writers, researchers, and editors in fifty-two state and territorial offices and produced a prodigious number of publications—including the American Guide Series, oral histories, ethnographies, collections of folklore and books for children—well over one thousand, but likely many more: the exact number is unknowable, and new discoveries have surfaced in the wake of each successive bibliography. Over sixty years, Jeffer’s passion for collecting the output of the Federal Writers’ Project and its offshoots brought him into contact with the foremost antiquarian book dealers of the day, former Writers’ Project employees, and leading collectors across the United States. With his wife Rachel, he made great use of auctions, eBay, and trades with other notable collectors and dealers. Through the decades, he searched for these publications by visiting bookstores in towns and cities around the country, directly contacting booksellers, and later maintaining a private network of like-minded collectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two core influences in Jeffer’s collecting activities were his close relationship with collector Fred Board of Connecticut and collector/book dealer Arthur Scharf of Pennsylvania. Board’s own collection of the State Guides (apart from his larger FWP collection) later served as an inspiration to his great-nephew Scott Borchert, which led Borchert to write his recent excellent history of the Project, &lt;i&gt;Republic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America&lt;/i&gt; (New York, 2021). Besides selling and trading, Arthur Scharf was a source of bibliographic information on the FWP publications. Like most serious collectors of the FWP, when Evanell Powell self-published her ambitious (if amateur) WPA Writers’ Publication: &lt;i&gt;A complete bibliographic checklist… of items, major and minor, of the Federal Writers' Project and Program&lt;/i&gt; (Palm Beach, 1974), Jeffer took advantage of the information there to hunt for more titles—and to find many titles unknown to Powell, historians, and scholars. Of the over twelve hundred published FWP titles in the Jeffer collection, approximately one hundred and fifty FWP items were unknown to Powell and historians, thus representing an excellent opportunity for further research. The presence of sixteen original, unpublished FWP works adds significantly to the prospects for research in the collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collecting the often ephemeral publications that characterized the richness and diversity, as well as controversy, of the project’s output, Jeffer has been guided by a desire to document this seminal period in American history, preserve it for posterity, and make it broadly available to students and researchers. In addition to rare published items, Jeffer sought out unpublished material as well—always with an eye for unique material that, in the words of one FWP catalog, embodied the project’s mission of “presenting America to all Americans.”  His collection contains copies of a number of exceedingly scarce titles, typescripts of unpublished works, and presentation copies gifted to New Deal luminaries such as Harry L. Hopkins, as well as publications from allied agencies such as the Federal Art Project, the Museum Extension Project, the Federal Theatre Project, and the Federal Music Project.  &lt;br&gt;
As demonstrated throughout the exhibit, The FWP’s lasting influence on literary and ethnographic work since the 1930s is strong, and the cultural resonance of the project continues unabated—including serving as the inspiration for a proposed twenty-first-century FWP, congressional legislation (Bill # HR 3054) introduced during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021 by Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA and Stanford, B.A., B.S., '91) and Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Benjamin Stone, Associate Director of Special Collections and Curator for American and British History; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their expert cataloging of books and manuscripts: Nancy Lorimer, Kay Teel, and their staff in the Metadata Department; For their assessment of materials Kristen St. John and Kimberly Kwan in Conservation Services; For his photography services Wayne Vanderkuil in the Digital Production Group; Glynn Edwards, Ann Myers, Brian Bethel, Gurudarshan Khalsa and especially Esther Wan in the Collection Services division of the Department of Special Collections, and Ben Albritton and Ever Rodriguez in Rare Books, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Library Hours page &lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epicenters: Navigating Recovery and Renewal from Disasters at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;In the wake of disaster, maps play many roles, shaping understanding of the event in the immediate aftermath, serving as visceral portrayals for those who were not there, and communicating both scale and extent of the tragedy. They gavanize support for rebuilding by showing new possible futures and can be used to memorialize the event, inscribing the memory over the landscape. Drawing upon sources from historical representations to contemporary satellite imagery, the maps in this exhibition explore various ways communities use maps to make sense of calamity and move forward from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;The exhibition was curated by Stanford student Muhammad Dhafer, winner of the 2024 California Map Society student exhibition competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This exhibition is ongoing and will be available until February 28th, 2024. To view the exhibit, visit the David Rumsey Map Center during its public drop-in hours.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Chaim Gingold, "Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine"  at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming authour Chaim Gingold as he discusses his book, "Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine," on November 13, 2024, in Hohbach Hall. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As play is intrinsic to humanity, it should come as no surprise that the history of computing is veined with playful simulations and games of all kinds. From the Balinese cockfight to Los Alamos’s Monte Carlo simulations, play and games, in all their kaleidoscopic glory, reflect the diverse cultures and communities of those who make and play them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk focuses upon &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;, the genre-defying urban planning hit from 1989, and the people who made it. We’ll examine how &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;’s design counts urban planning, videogames, graphical user interfaces, and complexity science among its many influences. This set the stage for &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;’s reception and enabled Maxis, &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;’s developer, to establish relationships with wide-ranging communities: Nintendo, the Santa Fe Institute, Wall Street venture capitalists, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on people such as developers, managers, and investors sheds light on the messy process of software development—a negotiation between individuals, their aspirations and worldviews, and shape-shifting technologies. Springing forth from this mess came &lt;i&gt;The Sims&lt;/i&gt;, which required an extraordinary amount of research and development. But this same mess also thwarted Maxis’s solvency and its attempts to bring &lt;i&gt;The Sims&lt;/i&gt; to market. Ultimately, we’ll see how &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;, Maxis, and &lt;i&gt;The Sims&lt;/i&gt;—like games, play, and software more generally—reflect their time and place, and the people who make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chaim Gingold &lt;/b&gt;is the author of &lt;i&gt;Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine&lt;/i&gt; (MIT Press), which Stewart Brand called "one of the best origin stories ever told and the best account I've seen of how innovation actually occurs in computerdom.”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Gingold began his design career apprenticed to Will Wright on &lt;i&gt;Spore&lt;/i&gt;, where his chief accomplishment was designing the critically acclaimed&lt;i&gt; Spore Creature Creator. &lt;/i&gt;His projects, like &lt;i&gt;Earth: A Primer&lt;/i&gt;, a science book made of interactive toys, have been featured by &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CNN&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;New York Times.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:35 PM – 2:30 PM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning Keynote: Steve Citron-Pousty - Founder, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.techravenconsulting.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tech Raven Consulting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Quick Intro to AI/ML Vector Data for Geospatial Folks"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, AI machine learning has exploded in prominence. One of the key concepts used in the modeling and storage of AI is vectors. There is no doubt vector data management will be a key concern of most people concerned with the lifecycle of data management. Feeling like you should learn more and how you would use them in your data work? Then have I got a talk for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will start by explaining the concept of (embedding) vectors and how they are used in the AI life cycle. From there we will go into putting them into a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that those vectors are in a database we can talk about the use cases where the technology makes sense. As opposed to an RDBMS, vector databases are more tightly focused and optimized for particular use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ground this discussion in something more concrete, we will show live demos of the technology throughout the talks. By the time you leave you will have a strong base to go home and explore more (and impress friends at dinner parties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
