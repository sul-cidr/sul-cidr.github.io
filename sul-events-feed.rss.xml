      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: Authenticity by Design at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet is at an inflection point. With the growth of mis/disinformation, artificial intelligence and synthetic media, trust in information faces unprecedented threats. Authenticity is not guaranteed. At the same time, new technologies–referred to as “Web 3”–present opportunities to protect the integrity of data. These solutions can be applied to critical practices including investigative journalism, historical archiving, and the admissibility of legal evidence. This exhibit, curated by the &lt;a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/"&gt;Starling Lab for Data Integrity&lt;/a&gt;, asks: How might we design information systems for authenticity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/visitor-access" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Victoria Yau: “I slept in the mountain cloud” at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;黛文洵美：山水記憶&lt;br&gt;
Victoria Yau: “I slept in the mountain cloud” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by Stanford Libraries, the East Asia Library, and the Center for East Asian Studies. Organized and guest curated by Beryl Zhou, graduate student, Center for East Asian Studies, and Ellen Huang, Ph.D, distinguished practitioner at the Center for East Asian Studies and associate professor of art history and material culture at ArtCenter College of Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanghai-born artist Victoria Yau (1939–2023) created around 300 works of abstract ink paintings, watercolors, multimedia collages, prints, and textiles after she moved to the United States from Taipei. These artworks, spanning nearly half a century of art-making in Chicago, New York and the Southwest, testify to her commitment to abstraction and investment in material experimentation. Featuring a selection of works in a range of media—and complemented by the artist’s own writings, collections, and poetry—this exhibition asks viewers to consider the transformation of East Asian landscape painting from compositional structure into abbreviated form emphasizing texture and line. Gathered together here for the first time since her passing, the works and texts on display explore how Yau negotiated disparate experiences of geopolitical flux, immigration, and physical struggle throughout her seventy-year career. Modern in their simplicity but complex in their historical and international references, Victoria Yau’s mountain clouds, her own poetic reworking of the historical term for landscape painting, “mountain-water 山水,” signal the intricacies of international contemporary art through the vantage of an Asian diasporic woman artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SCRABrraaNNG! The Explosion of Futurist Poetry at McMurtry Building</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;Bowes Library’s Autumn 2024 exhibition, &lt;i&gt;SCRABrrRrraaNNG! The Explosion of&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Futurist Poetry&lt;/i&gt;, explores the unique history of Italian Futurist poetry during its first period (1909-1918). Futurism, founded by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1909, was a leading avant-garde movement in Europe that rejected history and tradition in the name of technology, dynamism, and violence. In 1912, Marinetti declared war on his Symbolist predecessors, inventing a new form of poetics that tested the limits of typography and aimed to shock readers with obliterated syntax, onomatopoeias, and word-images. On display are featured items from Bowes and Green Libraries' Special Collections, as well as the Futurist Archive's private collection, including Marinetti's seminal work of "words-in-freedom,"&lt;i&gt;Zang&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Tumb Tuuum&lt;/i&gt; (1914), and several first editions by other Futurist poets. Curated by Ty Davidian, PhD Candidate in Italian. Sponsored by the Department of French and Italian and the Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;Library hours: M-Th 9-7pm, Friday 9-5pm, Sunday 12-6pm. Opening reception Oct. 10, 4-6pm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New Deal &amp; The Federal Writers' Project at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-UT_h28D9ylo9I3qEOfJJXmbaL_Ol8wq4VIw_k6PEU4/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New Deal &amp;amp; The Federal Writers' Project | Selections from the Bruce and Rachel Jeffer Collection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on view May 6, 2024, through January 26, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by childhood automobile trips across the U.S. with his father and a lifelong love of American history and literature, Los Angeles attorney Bruce Jeffer assembled a magnificent collection—totaling nearly two thousand titles—of the Federal Writers’ Project and related WPA and New Deal publications. He and his wife Rachel gifted it to the Stanford Libraries Department of Special Collections in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created as a New Deal program within the Works Progress Administration in 1935, the Federal Writers’ Project (Federal Writers’ Program 1939–1943) employed as many as six thousand writers, researchers, and editors in fifty-two state and territorial offices and produced a prodigious number of publications—including the American Guide Series, oral histories, ethnographies, collections of folklore and books for children—well over one thousand, but likely many more: the exact number is unknowable, and new discoveries have surfaced in the wake of each successive bibliography. Over sixty years, Jeffer’s passion for collecting the output of the Federal Writers’ Project and its offshoots brought him into contact with the foremost antiquarian book dealers of the day, former Writers’ Project employees, and leading collectors across the United States. With his wife Rachel, he made great use of auctions, eBay, and trades with other notable collectors and dealers. Through the decades, he searched for these publications by visiting bookstores in towns and cities around the country, directly contacting booksellers, and later maintaining a private network of like-minded collectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two core influences in Jeffer’s collecting activities were his close relationship with collector Fred Board of Connecticut and collector/book dealer Arthur Scharf of Pennsylvania. Board’s own collection of the State Guides (apart from his larger FWP collection) later served as an inspiration to his great-nephew Scott Borchert, which led Borchert to write his recent excellent history of the Project, &lt;i&gt;Republic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America&lt;/i&gt; (New York, 2021). Besides selling and trading, Arthur Scharf was a source of bibliographic information on the FWP publications. Like most serious collectors of the FWP, when Evanell Powell self-published her ambitious (if amateur) WPA Writers’ Publication: &lt;i&gt;A complete bibliographic checklist… of items, major and minor, of the Federal Writers' Project and Program&lt;/i&gt; (Palm Beach, 1974), Jeffer took advantage of the information there to hunt for more titles—and to find many titles unknown to Powell, historians, and scholars. Of the over twelve hundred published FWP titles in the Jeffer collection, approximately one hundred and fifty FWP items were unknown to Powell and historians, thus representing an excellent opportunity for further research. The presence of sixteen original, unpublished FWP works adds significantly to the prospects for research in the collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collecting the often ephemeral publications that characterized the richness and diversity, as well as controversy, of the project’s output, Jeffer has been guided by a desire to document this seminal period in American history, preserve it for posterity, and make it broadly available to students and researchers. In addition to rare published items, Jeffer sought out unpublished material as well—always with an eye for unique material that, in the words of one FWP catalog, embodied the project’s mission of “presenting America to all Americans.”  His collection contains copies of a number of exceedingly scarce titles, typescripts of unpublished works, and presentation copies gifted to New Deal luminaries such as Harry L. Hopkins, as well as publications from allied agencies such as the Federal Art Project, the Museum Extension Project, the Federal Theatre Project, and the Federal Music Project.  &lt;br&gt;
As demonstrated throughout the exhibit, The FWP’s lasting influence on literary and ethnographic work since the 1930s is strong, and the cultural resonance of the project continues unabated—including serving as the inspiration for a proposed twenty-first-century FWP, congressional legislation (Bill # HR 3054) introduced during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021 by Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA and Stanford, B.A., B.S., '91) and Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Benjamin Stone, Associate Director of Special Collections and Curator for American and British History; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their expert cataloging of books and manuscripts: Nancy Lorimer, Kay Teel, and their staff in the Metadata Department; For their assessment of materials Kristen St. John and Kimberly Kwan in Conservation Services; For his photography services Wayne Vanderkuil in the Digital Production Group; Glynn Edwards, Ann Myers, Brian Bethel, Gurudarshan Khalsa and especially Esther Wan in the Collection Services division of the Department of Special Collections, and Ben Albritton and Ever Rodriguez in Rare Books, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Library Hours page &lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Weyodi Oldbear, "As Many Ships as Stars"  at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are invited to join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming game designer and author Weyodi Old Bear as she discuss her latest book, &lt;i&gt;As Many Ships as Stars&lt;/i&gt;, on October 16, 2024. This event is virtual and requires an RSVP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weyodi OldBear’s book,&lt;i&gt; As Many Ships As Stars&lt;/i&gt;, is a science fiction retelling of the oral tradition of Comanche horse acquisition. Set in the future the story details how modern characters Indigenize space, essentially transforming themselves to be more traditionally Comanche the more futuristic their lives become. She will discuss the story and the impetus behind its writing and give a short reading from the book, followed by a question and answer period. &lt;a href="https://pt.android-press.com/product-page/as-many-ships-as-stars-paperback"&gt;A copy of the book may be purchased here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weyodi OldBear is a voting citizen of the Comanche Nation who has been writing on a daily basis since she was 7 years old. She is disabled in a seizures and can't see much out of one eye sort of way. She writes from a Numunu (Comanche) perspective because that is her original factory setting. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Carpentries @ Stanford: Data Visualization in R</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This workshop is a gentle introduction to working with the ggplot2 visualization library in R for those who have moderate programming experience in R. If you know how to work with datasets (variables, matrices, dataframes) and functions in R, but you have never created figures beyond maybe a few base R visualizations (using the plot, hist, barplot functions), then this class is a good fit for you! For a more foundational introduction to R, consider attending &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/introduction-to-r"&gt;Introduction to R&lt;/a&gt; (an in-person event) on October 10, 2024. By the end of this workshop, you will have learned the syntax of ggplot2, how to modify and customize graph aesthetics, how to generate 1D and 2D plots, and how to save your figures to your computer. Time permitting, we will explore a few extra features such as faceting, custom colors, and themes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Register &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/9oEYHisKrnMCoiMHA"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to attend. This workshop is open exclusively to current Stanford affiliates, and registration will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Space is limited, and a waitlist will be available once spots are filled. (Please note: You must be logged in to Google Drive with your SUNet ID to access the registration form.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location: Virtual (A zoom link will be sent to registrants one week before the event.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Date and Time: 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, Wednesday, October 16, 2024&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Epicenters: Navigating Recovery and Renewal from Disasters at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;In the wake of disaster, maps play many roles, shaping understanding of the event in the immediate aftermath, serving as visceral portrayals for those who were not there, and communicating both scale and extent of the tragedy. They gavanize support for rebuilding by showing new possible futures and can be used to memorialize the event, inscribing the memory over the landscape. Drawing upon sources from historical representations to contemporary satellite imagery, the maps in this exhibition explore various ways communities use maps to make sense of calamity and move forward from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;The exhibition was curated by Stanford student Muhammad Dhafer, winner of the 2024 California Map Society student exhibition competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This exhibition is ongoing and will be available until February 28th, 2024. To view the exhibit, visit the David Rumsey Map Center during its public drop-in hours.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Earth Engine 101 (Wednesday, October 16th) at Branner Earth Sciences Library</title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Earth Engine 101: Introduction to Earth Engine for beginners&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Earth Engine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://earthengine.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Google Earth Engine &lt;/a&gt;is a geospatial processing service. With Earth Engine, you can perform geospatial processing at scale, powered by Google Cloud Platform. The purpose of Earth Engine is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an interactive platform for geospatial algorithm development at scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable high-impact, data-driven science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make substantive progress on global challenges that involve large geospatial datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://earthengine.google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Google Earth Engine&lt;/a&gt; combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities and makes it available for scientists, researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Presenter: &lt;/b&gt;Stace Maples&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this workshop is for Stanford University affiliates, only. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description&lt;/b&gt;: The Earth Engine API (application programming interface) provides the ability to create your own algorithms to process raster and vector imagery. This session is geared toward people who would like to analyze satellite and vector data. The session will be hands-on, using the Earth Engine Javascript code editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the class will be an introduction to Remote Sensing, in general. The second half will focus on introducing the Google Earth Engine Platform, and accessing imagery, creating composites, and running analyses over stacks of images, computing statistics on imagery, creating charts and exporting the results of your analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prerequisites: &lt;/b&gt;No previous experience with Earth Engine or JavaScript is necessary for the beginner workshop, but programming experience, basic knowledge of remote sensing and/or GIS are highly desirable. Willingness to learn programming is required. Participants with no programming experience will require additional attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get Access to Google Earth Engine Immediately!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are registering with a @Stanford.edu email address, it is possible that you already have access to Google Earth Engine, through the Stanford Geospatial Center's collaboration with The Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. You can test this by going to &lt;a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/f983a2d843739e23ffb77f336ad6d4fb" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;https://code.earthengine.google.com/f983a2d843739e23ffb77f336ad6d4fb&lt;/a&gt; and logging in with your Stanford.edu credentials. The link should load a script that will produce a "Tanaka Hillshade" map of the terrain in the Yosemite Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sewers for surveillance: Harnessing wastewater monitoring data for public health action (Bay Area Open Science Group October Meeting)</title>
      <description>&lt;p style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This month, the Bay Area Open Science Group will be joined by Elana Chan, a Civil &amp;amp; Environmental Engineering PhD Candidate in the Boehm Research Group at Stanford studying how wastewater monitoring data may be interpreted for public health action. Elana was recently awarded the Stanford University Libraries Data Sharing Prize for her transparent research practices including publishing her data and code alongside her research papers with detailed documentation in the Stanford Digital Repository.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Bay Area Open Science Group&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Bay Area Open Science Group is a growing community for Bay Area (and more!) academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning. Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whatever Victory Takes: The Lithuanian Perspective on Russia’s War against Ukraine and Transatlantic Security at Encina Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with Ambassador of Lithuania to the United States Audra Plepytė and Director of the Freeman-Spogli Institute Michael McFaul on Russia’s war against Ukraine, its global implications, and transatlantic support to Ukraine:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatever Victory Takes: The Lithuanian Perspective on Russia’s War against Ukraine and Transatlantic Security&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we are nearing 1,000 days of Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, the debate in Washington, D.C., and European capitals remains on what Ukraine can and cannot do to defend itself, its territory, and the whole democratic world. Lithuania has been among the most vocal supporters of Ukraine advocating that instead of Western commitments to stand with Ukraine as long as it takes, commitment to Ukraine’s victory is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will feature a discussion on what is at stake in Russia’s war on Ukraine and why it matters beyond Ukraine and Europe. Ambassador Plepytė and Professor McFaul will discuss security on NATO’s Eastern flank, Western strategy for Ukraine, and the U.S. role in standing up to the new ‘axis of evil’ in defense of democracy and the free world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ambassador &lt;b&gt;Audra Plepytė&lt;/b&gt; was appointed as Lithuania’s Ambassador to the United States of America and to the United Mexican States in 2021. Before this she was a Lithuanian Permanent Representative to the United Nations where she facilitated several negotiations, led the Group of Friends, and was elected to executive bodies of UN instruments and institutions, including being elected as the President of the Executive Board of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in 2021. As a career diplomat for over 30 years, she has held numerous positions within the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dealing with bilateral and multilateral issues, heading the European Union Department (2014–2017), the Personnel Department, and International Missions and Conflict Prevention Division. She was also &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lithuania’s ambassador to Spain, World Tourism Organization from 2010 till 2014.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael McFaul&lt;/b&gt; is Director at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, the Ken Olivier and Angela Nomellini Professor of International Studies in the Department of Political Science, and the Peter and Helen Bing Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1995. He served for five years in the Obama administration, first as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs at the National Security Council at the White House (2009-2012), and then as U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation (2012-2014).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Opening remarks will be delivered by &lt;b&gt;Michael Keller&lt;/b&gt;, Vice Provost and University Librarian.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This in-person event is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://info-fsi.stanford.edu/acton/fs/blocks/showLandingPage/a/19053/p/p-004f/t/page/fm/0"&gt;Registration is required.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title> Justice &amp; Equity in Food &amp; Agriculture</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;Please join Stanford University Libraries for a webinar on &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justice &amp;amp; Equity in Food &amp;amp; Agriculture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Karli A. Moore (Lumbee)&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Jocelyn Breeland&lt;/b&gt; will discuss the issues around food/agricultural security and equity that Indigenous communities and Black farmers are facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karli A. Moore (Lumbee), PhD Candidate Environment and Resources, Knight-Hennessy Scholar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Moving Towards Indigenous Food Sovereignty&lt;/i&gt; – Indigenous communities and Tribal nations sharing borders with the United States are working hard to create healthy, thriving food systems. Unfortunately, structural, economic, and societal barriers make it difficult to exercise food sovereignty. We'll talk about a number of pressing issues and folks working for solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;Karli grew up on a family farm near Prospect, NC, and aspires to advance food sovereignty and economic development for Native peoples through sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jocelyn Breeland, Chief Communications and Marketing Officer for Residential &amp;amp; Dining Enterprise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Black Farmers: Together Toward Justice and Equity&lt;/i&gt; – The Black Farmers Initiative, led by R&amp;amp;DE’s Stanford Food Institute and Oakland-based partner Farms to Grow, Inc., works with farmers and distributors to reverse the effects of generations of racism by helping Black Farmers enjoy the same support and market access as other farmers. In this session, Jocelyn will outline the Black Farmers Initiative, discuss the discrimination Black farmers still face today, and the ways the initiative is successfully advancing toward equity and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;Jocelyn is a member of the 2023 and 2024 Stanford IDEAL Honor Rolls. She is also an alumna of Stanford University, with a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Circling the Square: How Geometrical and Administrative Mapping Intersected in Seventeenth-Century Eurasia at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the historiography of East Asian cartography, maps produced by Jesuit missionaries to China have played a prominent role. It is often assumed that Jesuits successfully transmitted ‘scientific cartography’ from Europe to China, so that the question of the impact of their maps on cartography in East Asia has stood central in the literature. This talk problematizes this approach by reconstructing the intellectual, social, and material landscapes that informed the meeting of two vastly different modes of mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecture will be given by distinguished map scholar Mario Cams, an Associate Professor of Chinese Studies at KU Leuven in the Netherlands, and the Kratter Visiting Professor in the Stanford History Department. Professor Cams is a historian of science who specializes in cartographic exchange between Europe and China in the 16th-17th centuries. He conducts research in multiple languages, including Chinese, Latin, French, German, and English, and he stresses the importance of social networks and physical objects in map history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please register in advance to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introduction to GDAL/OGR, the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library at Branner Earth Sciences Library</title>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL/OGR) is an open-source translator library for working with geospatial data. GDAL/OGR contains a variety of useful command line utilities that can be easier or more efficient to use than standalone GIS software or rolling your own code. In this workshop you will learn how to use GDAL to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect and query datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert data between different formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update and transform spatial reference systems (projections)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clip and subset data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create tile indexes and mosaics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This documentary reveals the explosive implications of women's economic participation as we follow radically different women from Sri Lanka, Peru, and Senegal who are fighting to build businesses that create job opportunities for women, while also contributing to the reduction of poverty in their communities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOidW9NJmhA" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;u style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;View the trailer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt; for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;She Rises Up &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sherisesupfilm.com/" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;u style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;learn more about the film&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Recognized with scores of awards, that work took them to over 60 countries around the world. It is that experience that allows them to produce compelling films that take place in many remote corners of the world; sharing stories and voices that might not otherwise be heard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Chaim Gingold, "Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine"  at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming authour Chaim Gingold as he discusses his book, "Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine," on November 13, 2024, in Hohbach Hall. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As play is intrinsic to humanity, it should come as no surprise that the history of computing is veined with playful simulations and games of all kinds. From the Balinese cockfight to Los Alamos’s Monte Carlo simulations, play and games, in all their kaleidoscopic glory, reflect the diverse cultures and communities of those who make and play them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk focuses upon &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;, the genre-defying urban planning hit from 1989, and the people who made it. We’ll examine how &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;’s design counts urban planning, videogames, graphical user interfaces, and complexity science among its many influences. This set the stage for &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;’s reception and enabled Maxis, &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;’s developer, to establish relationships with wide-ranging communities: Nintendo, the Santa Fe Institute, Wall Street venture capitalists, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on people such as developers, managers, and investors sheds light on the messy process of software development—a negotiation between individuals, their aspirations and worldviews, and shape-shifting technologies. Springing forth from this mess came &lt;i&gt;The Sims&lt;/i&gt;, which required an extraordinary amount of research and development. But this same mess also thwarted Maxis’s solvency and its attempts to bring &lt;i&gt;The Sims&lt;/i&gt; to market. Ultimately, we’ll see how &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;, Maxis, and &lt;i&gt;The Sims&lt;/i&gt;—like games, play, and software more generally—reflect their time and place, and the people who make them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chaim Gingold &lt;/b&gt;is the author of &lt;i&gt;Building SimCity: How to Put the World in a Machine&lt;/i&gt; (MIT Press), which Stewart Brand called "one of the best origin stories ever told and the best account I've seen of how innovation actually occurs in computerdom.”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Gingold began his design career apprenticed to Will Wright on &lt;i&gt;Spore&lt;/i&gt;, where his chief accomplishment was designing the critically acclaimed&lt;i&gt; Spore Creature Creator. &lt;/i&gt;His projects, like &lt;i&gt;Earth: A Primer&lt;/i&gt;, a science book made of interactive toys, have been featured by &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CNN&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;New York Times.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welcome and introduction to the event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:35 PM – 2:30 PM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning Keynote: Steve Citron-Pousty - Founder, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.techravenconsulting.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tech Raven Consulting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Quick Intro to AI/ML Vector Data for Geospatial Folks"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F869804739%2F153479166967%2F1%2Foriginal.20241008-191602?h=740&amp;amp;w=1200&amp;amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;amp;q=75&amp;amp;sharp=10&amp;amp;s=96e2eff03571ad2f2fd776b0a24d9272"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, AI machine learning has exploded in prominence. One of the key concepts used in the modeling and storage of AI is vectors. There is no doubt vector data management will be a key concern of most people concerned with the lifecycle of data management. Feeling like you should learn more and how you would use them in your data work? Then have I got a talk for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will start by explaining the concept of (embedding) vectors and how they are used in the AI life cycle. From there we will go into putting them into a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that those vectors are in a database we can talk about the use cases where the technology makes sense. As opposed to an RDBMS, vector databases are more tightly focused and optimized for particular use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ground this discussion in something more concrete, we will show live demos of the technology throughout the talks. By the time you leave you will have a strong base to go home and explore more (and impress friends at dinner parties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
