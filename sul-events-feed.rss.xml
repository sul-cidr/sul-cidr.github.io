      <title>Religion in Manga and Anime: A Poster Exhibition by IntroSems RELIGST 6N at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Introductory Seminar RELIGST 6N “Religion in Anime and Manga,” taught by Professor Michaela Mross, students explored religious themes and imagery in manga (Japanese comics) and anime (animated films or TV series). The exhibit on display in the East Asia Library features academic posters on manga and anime, such as &lt;i&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Kamisama Kiss&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Deathnote&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Jujutsu Kaisen&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&lt;/i&gt;, that the students created as their final projects. The posters aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the cultural and religious background of these modern works, produced for mainly entertainment purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is located in the 3rd floor exhibit cases at the East Asia Library. An opening reception will be held on Wednesday, March 13, from 1:30 - 2:45 PM in the East Asia Library, room 224.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibition is sponsored by Stanford Libraries, the East Asia Library, the Introductory Seminars Program, and the Department of Religious Studies&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Color Deceives: Le Corbusier &amp; Josef Albers at McMurtry Building</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bowes Library’s Spring 2024 exhibition, &lt;i&gt;Color Deceives&lt;/i&gt;, explores the color theories of modern artist Josef Albers (German-American, 1888-1976) and modern architect Le Corbusier (Swiss-French, 1887-1965). Albers famously wrote, “color deceives continually,” a statement that becomes increasingly true through observing the complex interactions of color he documents in &lt;i&gt;Interaction of Color &lt;/i&gt;(1963). Likewise, Le Corbusier believed color to be “a means as powerful as the ground plan and the section itself.” His designs turn to polychromatic color schemes to create cohesive interiors and generate specific spatial and mood effects. The featured items from Bowes Library’s special collections highlight color as a powerful tool in every kind of art making. Curated by Abigail Schweizer '24. Library hours: M-Th 9-7pm, Friday 9-5pm, Sunday 12-6pm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Celebrating the Tompkins Archives at Traitel Building</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford University Libraries is delighted to invite you to an event on Earth Day, April 22, to celebrate three wonderful additions to our Sustainability collections, the archives of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tompkinsconservation.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Tompkins Conservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Doug Tompkins&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Kris Tompkins&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us as we hear from Kris Tompkins, the Cofounder and President of Tompkins Conservation, as well as leadership from Rewilding Chile and Rewilding Argentina, and Stanford staff and faculty to learn more about their important efforts and how these archives will be used at Stanford and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://forms.gle/nUum4c1skzhk7q9J6" target="_blank"&gt;Registration is required to attend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The event is free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug and Kris Tompkins are considered to be two of the most successful conservation philanthropists in history. Through their efforts and that of Tompkins Conservation, approximately &lt;a href="http://www.tompkinsconservation.org/explore/" target="_blank"&gt;14.8 million acres of parklands&lt;/a&gt; in Chile and Argentina have been protected, helping to restore native habitats and wildlife. They helped to create or expand 15 national parks, 2 marine national parks, underwrote 32 rewilding, conservation and monitoring projects, and supported 10 community-based projects. The organization has reintroduced native species, promoted regenerative agriculture, and positioned national parks as economic engines for the local communities. Through offspring organizations—Rewilding Chile and Rewilding Argentina—the work continues today.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
The archives of Tompkins Conservation and the personal papers of Doug Tompkins and Kris Tompkins will come to Stanford University Libraries providing researchers and students access to firsthand documentation on national park creation, environmental policy, conservation, rewilding, philanthropy, and environmental activism. The collection will consist of primary and secondary resources for research and scholarship providing first-hand documentation on national park creation, environmental policy, international environmental activism, and organizational activities required to work across governmental and private entities. Due to the activities of the organization in Chile and Argentina, this archive will be relevant to researchers across Stanford and in the broader academic community studying ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, environmental and international policy, social justice, land management, and economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conservation Director, Ingrid Espinoza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

She has managed the land and marine conservation programs, geographic information systems, and land surveys for the organization. She worked on the team that achieved the declaration of Nature Sanctuary of Pumalín Park and the creation of Corcovado National Park in 2005. In the same way, she participated in the creation of the Yendegaia National Park in 2013 and the historic donation for the conformation of the Route of Parks of the Chilean Patagonia, which was concreted in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bo Li&lt;/b&gt; will discuss fiscal and financial policy priorities to meet Paris Agreement goals; key policy recommendations ranging from carbon taxation to scaling up climate finance; and challenges and opportunities for international cooperation on climate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/senior-officials/Bios/bo-li"&gt;Mr. Bo Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; assumed the role of Deputy Managing Director at the IMF on August 23, 2021. He is responsible for the IMF’s work on about 90 countries as well as on a wide range of policy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before joining the IMF, Mr. Li worked for many years at the People’s Bank of China, most recently as Deputy Governor. He earlier headed the Monetary Policy, Monetary Policy II, and Legal and Regulation Departments, where he played an important role in the reform of state-owned banks, the drafting of China’s anti-money-laundering law, the internationalization of the renminbi, and the establishment of China’s macroprudential policy framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the PBoC, Mr. Li served as Vice Mayor of Chongqing—China’s largest municipality, with a population of over 30 million—where he oversaw the city’s financial-sector development, international trade, and foreign direct investment. Mr. Li was also Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. He started his career at the New York law firm of Davis Polk &amp;amp; Wardwell, where he was a practicing attorney for five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Li holds a Ph.D. from Stanford University and an M.A. from Boston University, both in economics, as well as a J.D., magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School. He received his undergraduate education from Renmin University of China in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family of &lt;b&gt;Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh&lt;/b&gt; donated his personal archive to the Stanford Libraries' Special Collections and endowed the Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh Memorial Lecture series to honor his legacy and to inspire future generations. Dr. Sam-Chung Hsieh (1919-2004) was former Governor of the Central Bank in Taiwan. During his tenure, he was responsible for the world's largest foreign exchange reserves, and was widely recognized for achieving stability and economic growth. In his long and distinguished career as economist and development specialist, he held key positions in multilateral institutions including the Asian Development Bank, where as founding Director, he was instrumental in advancing the green revolution and in the transformation of rural Asia. &lt;a href="https://hsiehlecture.sites.stanford.edu/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more about Dr. Hsieh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New Deal &amp; The Federal Writers' Project at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;i&gt;The New Deal &amp;amp; The Federal Writers' Project | Selections from the Bruce and Rachel Jeffer Collection&lt;/i&gt;, on view May 6, 2024, through January 26, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by childhood automobile trips across the U.S. with his father and a lifelong love of American history and literature, Los Angeles attorney Bruce Jeffer assembled a magnificent collection—totaling nearly two thousand titles—of the Federal Writers’ Project and related WPA and New Deal publications. He and his wife Rachel gifted it to the Stanford Libraries Department of Special Collections in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created as a New Deal program within the Works Progress Administration in 1935, the Federal Writers’ Project (Federal Writers’ Program 1939–1943) employed as many as six thousand writers, researchers, and editors in fifty-two state and territorial offices and produced a prodigious number of publications—including the American Guide Series, oral histories, ethnographies, collections of folklore and books for children—well over one thousand, but likely many more: the exact number is unknowable, and new discoveries have surfaced in the wake of each successive bibliography. Over sixty years, Jeffer’s passion for collecting the output of the Federal Writers’ Project and its offshoots brought him into contact with the foremost antiquarian book dealers of the day, former Writers’ Project employees, and leading collectors across the United States. With his wife Rachel, he made great use of auctions, eBay, and trades with other notable collectors and dealers. Through the decades, he searched for these publications by visiting bookstores in towns and cities around the country, directly contacting booksellers, and later maintaining a private network of like-minded collectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two core influences in Jeffer’s collecting activities were his close relationship with collector Fred Board of Connecticut and collector/book dealer Arthur Scharf of Pennsylvania. Board’s own collection of the State Guides (apart from his larger FWP collection) later served as an inspiration to his great-nephew Scott Borchert, which led Borchert to write his recent excellent history of the Project, &lt;i&gt;Republic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America&lt;/i&gt; (New York, 2021). Besides selling and trading, Arthur Scharf was a source of bibliographic information on the FWP publications. Like most serious collectors of the FWP, when Evanell Powell self-published her ambitious (if amateur) WPA Writers’ Publication: &lt;i&gt;A complete bibliographic checklist… of items, major and minor, of the Federal Writers' Project and Program&lt;/i&gt; (Palm Beach, 1974), Jeffer took advantage of the information there to hunt for more titles—and to find many titles unknown to Powell, historians, and scholars. Of the over twelve hundred published FWP titles in the Jeffer collection, approximately one hundred and fifty FWP items were unknown to Powell and historians, thus representing an excellent opportunity for further research. The presence of sixteen original, unpublished FWP works adds significantly to the prospects for research in the collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collecting the often ephemeral publications that characterized the richness and diversity, as well as controversy, of the project’s output, Jeffer has been guided by a desire to document this seminal period in American history, preserve it for posterity, and make it broadly available to students and researchers. In addition to rare published items, Jeffer sought out unpublished material as well—always with an eye for unique material that, in the words of one FWP catalog, embodied the project’s mission of “presenting America to all Americans.”  His collection contains copies of a number of exceedingly scarce titles, typescripts of unpublished works, and presentation copies gifted to New Deal luminaries such as Harry L. Hopkins, as well as publications from allied agencies such as the Federal Art Project, the Museum Extension Project, the Federal Theatre Project, and the Federal Music Project.  &lt;br&gt;
As demonstrated throughout the exhibit, The FWP’s lasting influence on literary and ethnographic work since the 1930s is strong, and the cultural resonance of the project continues unabated—including serving as the inspiration for a proposed twenty-first-century FWP, congressional legislation (Bill # HR 3054) introduced during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021 by Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA and Stanford, B.A., B.S., '91) and Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Benjamin Stone, Associate Director of Special Collections and Curator for American and British History; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their expert cataloging of books and manuscripts: Nancy Lorimer, Kay Teel, and their staff in the Metadata Department; For their assessment of materials Kristen St. John and Kimberly Kwan in Conservation Services; For his photography services Wayne Vanderkuil in the Digital Production Group; Glynn Edwards, Ann Myers, Brian Bethel, Gurudarshan Khalsa and especially Esther Wan in the Collection Services division of the Department of Special Collections, and Ben Albritton and Ever Rodriguez in Rare Books, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Library Hours page &lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paper Worlds: Urbano Monte and the Global Renaissance at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Since its arrival in the Rumsey Map Center, the Milanese cartographer Urbano Monte’s 1587 world map has become one of the uniquely compelling artifacts in our collection.  One of three surviving manuscript copies, it shows us how an armchair traveler viewed the world from Milan at the end of the Renaissance.  Monte (1544-1613) created his map after witnessing the Tenshō embassy (1582-90) visit his city before returning to Japan.  Monte’s map was a product of global curiosity as well as a synthesis of Renaissance cartography, travel narratives, histories, and news of the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This workshop places Urbano Monte’s world map in its different contexts – local, regional, and global – through a discussion of cartography, geography, and in curiosity in an age of Iberian and Asian empires.  We will juxtapose his project of mapmaking in relation to the voyage of the Florentine merchant Francesco Carletti (1573-1636), whose account of his accidental circumnavigation of the world in 1594-1602 is being edited for new Italian and English editions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This event requires registration. Link to register coming soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Organizer:  Zach Dakota Haines (Stanford, Music)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join the Stanford Camerata and the University of Southern California Early Music Ensemble for a concert that follows the Tenshō Embassy through music! In 1583, four young Japanese legates and their party from the Jesuit mission in Nagasaki embarked on a seven-year journey across the globe, to Rome and back. Their leader, Alessandro Valignano, sought to increase awareness of the mission and their financial needs, so he organized the embassy that represented Christian Japanese daimyōs to relay their obeisance the pope. Throughout their travels, the boys received music lessons, performed at the cathedrals and princely courts, and were present to numerous splendid performances as part of the grand pomp and circumstance surrounding their visit. We will perform vocal and instrumental music that the Japanese boys may have heard or played throughout the trip, featuring composers such as Carreira, Palestrina, Gabrieli, and many more. We will explore the role that music played in the seven-year-long embassy and the significance of a European musical presence in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabletop Tuesdays: Rising Waters at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us as we explore how board game designers are creating games like &lt;i&gt;Rising Waters&lt;/i&gt; to help educators teach historical events in the classroom. &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/357416/rising-waters"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rising Waters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a cooperative game where players experience the Mississippi flood of 1927 through the lens of the local African-American population. The game is deliberately designed to foster difficult conversations about the Jim Crow South by having players confront two forces at the same time–racism and nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tabletop Tuesdays i&lt;/i&gt;s an event series held on the third Tuesday of each month. At these events, we feature a selection of board games and collection items from across SUL's holdings around a specific theme. Drop in to learn about the month's featured game(s) and/or try some of the board games we have for open play at the Silicon Valley Archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Russia's War in Ukraine and its Implications on European Security: Why should America care? at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for an engaging discussion with Ambassador of Estonia to the U.S. Kristjan Prikk and Director of the Freeman-Spogli Institute Michael McFaul on:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Russia's War in Ukraine and its Implications on European Security: Why should America care?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than ten years into Russia's war against Ukraine and more than two years after Moscow launched a full-scale aggression, there is still no end in sight to the largest military conflict in Europe after WWII. What are the implications of this war on the security of Europe but also on the United States? What would it take to end the war and in what kind of a world will we all live on the day after it's all over? The event will feature a discussion on the possibility of a viable Western strategy for success that not only saves Ukraine but also strengthens the United States' role as the leader of the free world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Estonia's Ambassador to the U.S. &lt;b&gt;Kristjan Prikk&lt;/b&gt; started his mission in Washington, D.C. in May 2021.
