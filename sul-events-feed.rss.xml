      <title>Branner Library Monthly Book &amp; Map Exhibit - Oceans: Krill and Life in Extreme conditions at Mitchell Earth Sciences</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_biggest"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Branner Earth Sciences Library &amp;amp; Map Collection exhibit series: Oceans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the complexity of deep trenches to the shifting dynamics of sea ice, Earth’s oceans are vital to understanding our planet’s past, present, and future. In the 2025–2026 academic year, Branner Library’s exhibit series will feature ocean geology, biology, physics, chemistry, and mapping, highlighting their roles in regulating the climate, sustaining biodiversity, and connecting global systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explore Earth’s oceans’ complex biological and ecological systems that regulate climate and support life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December and January, discover one of Earth’s most significant yet understudied ecosystems. Examine the central role of Antarctic krill in structuring Southern Ocean food webs, and explore the physiological and ecological adaptations that enable life to persist in one of the planet’s coldest, windiest, and most isolated marine environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A selection of books, maps, and e-resources are displayed on the library's main floor exhibit space. The exhibit is available for viewing Monday through Friday during &lt;a href="https://library-hours.stanford.edu/libraries/branner"&gt;regular library open hours&lt;/a&gt;.  Please note that the library will be closed for Winter Closure from December 21, 2025 through January 4, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Essential Engagement: The Works of Joseph DeLappe at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;"The theoretical basis for my work lies in the belief that it is essential, as an artist and citizen of the world, to engage in and challenge the norms and expectations of the digital present and the larger cultural context." &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Joseph DeLappe, artist statement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;The prolific work of Joseph DeLappe, spanning a wide range of physical and digital mediums, provides an opportunity for critical reflection and thoughtful discussions about our relationship to technology and the post-9/11 political landscape. As the most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history and development of the Silicon Valley region, the Silicon Valley Archives is honored to exhibit a selection of this work and bring the history of recent technology into conversation with our present through this pioneering artist’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/about-stanford-libraries/visit-us"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on the Libraries’ website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joseph DeLappe&lt;/b&gt;, born San Francisco 1963, is an artist, activist and educator, he relocated to Scotland from the USA in 2017 where he is the Professor of Games and Tactical Media at Abertay University, Dundee. Working with electronic and digital media since 1983, projects in online gaming performance, sculpture and electromechanical installation have been shown throughout the world. He has developed works for venues such as Eyebeam Art and Technology in New York, The Guangdong Museum of Art, China, the Southern Utah Museum of Art and Transitio MX, Mexico City, among many others. Creative works and actions have been featured widely in scholarly journals, books and in the popular media, including the &lt;i&gt;New York Times, The Australian Morning Herald, Art in America, The Guardian &lt;/i&gt;and the BBC. &lt;a href="https://www.delappe.net/"&gt;More information about DeLappe and his artwork is available on his website. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To the World: China’s Multimedia Campaign during the Cold War at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The call “People of the World, Unite!” was a story China once told itself. When the world was polarized, the vision of global solidarity paradoxically prevailed in the People’s Republic of China during its Cold War isolation, manifested in a myriad of media categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To the World” unveils the diverse and far-reaching multimedia campaign in China. Drawing from the special collection at the East Asia library, this exhibition highlights how the regime propagated its international vision inward to the domestic audience from the 1950s to the 1970, and the interplay of ideas and ideologies shaping China’s self-presentation and portrayal of other countries and ethnicities in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibition also contributes to a vibrant and expanding field of scholarship that has significantly advanced our understanding of China’s media in recent history. Scholars such as Andrew Jones, Christine Ho, and Jie Li have explored the complexities of culture and history by integrating media and trans media, encompassing text, photography, film, visual art, music, and radio. The objects on display—multilingual editions of the Little Red Book, vinyl records, English textbooks, cartoon illustrations, and so on—serve as primary sources for understanding media and mediation in the everyday realities of the bygone era. Thus, the exhibition invites students, scholars, and the broader public to reconsider the complexities of China’s media landscape and encourages newlines of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhibition on view from September 22 to December 20, 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To the World” is curated by Yue Wu (PhD student, East Asian Languages and Cultures) and Zhaohui Xue (Curator for the Chinese Collection), with consultation from Professor Ban Wang (William Haas Professor in Chinese Studies). The exhibition is generously sponsored by the Stanford East Asia Library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Amos Gitai Archive at Stanford at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;a href="http://library.stanford.edu/special-collections-exhibits"&gt;The Amos Gitai Archive at Stanford&lt;/a&gt;, on view in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda from November 17, 2025, to February 15, 2026. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Amos Gitai’s strategy for his artistic legacy might be likened to the principle of "scatter in order to endure.” The way he has distributed traces of his films is a means of bringing to life, internationally, the memory of his filmography, the history of his young country, and universal themes about the fragility and degradation of memory. In this era of digital archives, Gitai decided early on to place his work at well-known international institutions, among them Stanford and the National Library of France. The Gitai archive at Stanford is characterized by its historical depth, featuring eight films spanning the years 1980 to 2014, as well as multimedia works from the 2020s. It contains 10.5 terabytes of photographs, screenplays, scripts, letters, and shooting reports. Also included are rushes, early cuts, subtitles, scores, and post-production documents revealing traces of the artistic process. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;i&gt;House&lt;/i&gt; trilogy (1980, 1998, 2005) revolves around a house in West Jerusalem—its successive inhabitants, their descendants, and the people who worked on it. It brings the memory this house bears to the eyes and ears of old and new generations, those who have stayed and those who have scattered, from the new arrivals from Turkey to the descendants of the Palestinian family now settled in Jordan, zooming out from a close-up of the house to encompass the entire geopolitical fate of the region. Whereas the House trilogy has historical depth and spans several generations, the &lt;i&gt;Borders&lt;/i&gt; trilogy—comprising &lt;i&gt;Promised Land&lt;/i&gt; (2004), &lt;i&gt;Free Zone&lt;/i&gt; (2005), and &lt;i&gt;Disengagement&lt;/i&gt; (2007)—was created over a shorter timeframe. These two trilogies, one documentary and one fiction, enter into a type of resonance. &lt;i&gt;News from Home / News from House&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Free Zone&lt;/i&gt; were shot simultaneously in 2004 and share images, cover the same geography and history, and both deal with porous memory and its gradual disintegration. The Gitai archive at Stanford also contains the archives of the films &lt;i&gt;Plus Tard Tu Comprendes&lt;/i&gt; (One Day You’ll Understand) (2008) and &lt;i&gt;Tsili&lt;/i&gt; (2014). Both are adaptations of literary works by contemporary authors. Both raise questions about the transmission of Holocaust memory in a European context, as well as cinematographic and ethical questions about how to film the words of others. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Gitai’s work on the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, part of his archives at the National Library of France, showcased in a forthcoming book published by Stanford University Libraries, could be described as a series of palimpsests, an endless process of revision and editing to understand precisely what happened and what was lost with Rabin’s assassination. And it is also an aesthetic journey, like &lt;i&gt;House&lt;/i&gt;, a decades-long exploration of broad histories told through focus on a single figure. With this exhibition, we invite you to explore Gitai’s archive at Stanford and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibition is curated by Ayda Melika and Eitan Kensky with texts by Marie-José Sanselme and Marie-Pierre Ulloa; produced by Deardra Fuzzell, with assistance from Elizabeth Fischbach and Pasha Tope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Above &amp; Below: Cartography Beyond Terrain at David Rumsey Map Center (Green Library) </title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Above &amp;amp; Below: Cartography Beyond Terrain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt; is an exhibition that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt; explores how cartography depicts the depths of the Earth, the ocean floor, weather systems, the solar system, and even the seemingly intangible internet – anything but the thin boundary that divides land and sky that we tend to associate with maps. The exhibition celebrates the multifaceted nature of mapping, inviting reflection on our interconnected existence and revealing the beauty and complexity of our world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Historic US Land Record Search at Branner Earth Sciences Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you heard of "public lands" but you're not quite sure what that means? Are you curious about what California's land looked like in the past? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Join us for an introduction to searching for historic land records&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt; and a tutorial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;on using the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;US Federal &lt;a href="https://glorecords.blm.gov/"&gt;General &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://glorecords.blm.gov/"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;Land&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt; Office &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;Record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://glorecords.blm.gov/"&gt;s database&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;This publicly-accessible database is maintained by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and contains thousands of land records, maps, and surveys that contain a multifaceted history of the American West (and beyond).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;In this session, we’ll cover how to find master title plats, cadastral surveys, surveyor’s field notes, as well as original patent documents (focusing on California) so if you want to learn how the US Federal government documents federal and private &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;land&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt; title, rights, and usage, this workshop is for you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are many uses of these primary source documents; whether you have an interest in history, federal law and governance, natural resources (agriculture, mining, forestry etc), land use (urbanization, privatization, environmentalism etc), or surveying and cartography, there should be something in this session for you! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We'll begin with an overview of &lt;b&gt;native lands&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;US federal public land management&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;surveying&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;legal land descriptions&lt;/b&gt;.

      <title>From Policy to Practice: Building Individual and Societal Resilience in Times of Crisis. The Case of the Baltic States at Encina Commons</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for a roundtable discussion featuring Ieva Birka (University of Latvia), Gabrielius Landsbergis (CISAC), and Indrek Sarap (CISAC):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Policy to Practice: Building Individual and Societal Resilience in Times of Crisis. The Case of the Baltic States&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research on individual crisis preparedness in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, but also in Finland and Germany, reveals a persistent gap between policy expectations and actual readiness. Despite clear national guidance on civil defence, the European Union Preparedness Union Strategy, and NATO’s Article 3 obligations, most urban residents lack basic resources and knowledge of emergency procedures. This disconnect reflects psychological, cultural, and structural barriers that current strategies fail to address.&lt;br&gt;
The Baltic region faces a multifaceted risk landscape, marked by geopolitical instability that gives rise to a range of threats, including hybrid threats, cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and the direct threat of war, as well as climate-related disasters. Governments increasingly emphasize individual responsibility within comprehensive defence frameworks, yet the assumption that citizens will autonomously prepare if given information is proving unrealistic. Closing this gap is critical for whole-of-society resilience and regional security.&lt;br&gt;
This roundtable will bring together scholars and practicioners from three Baltic countries to explore why the Baltic region’s citizens remain underprepared for crises despite clear policy guidance. The panel will also identify actionable strategies across political, military, and societal dimensions to close this gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ieva Birka&lt;/b&gt; is a Senior Researcher at the University of Latvia, Faculty of Economics and Political Science and Advanced Social and Political Research Institute. She currently leads three research projects focused on the dynamics of government-citizen cooperation in crisis preparedness and response. She is the author and coauthor of several publications focusing on issues of migration, social integration, feelings of belonging, dual citizenship, and diaspora diplomacy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gabrielius Landsbergis&lt;/b&gt; served as minister of foreign affairs of Lithuania from 2020 to 2024, a pivotal period for the region. During his tenure, Lithuania emerged as one of the most vocal supporters of Ukraine, Taiwan, and freedom fighters worldwide. Before that, he served in the Parliament of Lithuania from 2016, was chairman of the Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives), and was elected to the European Parliament in 2014. Prior to entering politics, Gabrielius Landsbergis was a career diplomat.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indrek Sarap &lt;/b&gt;is a Researcher at the Estonian Military Academy and a Visiting Scholar at Stanford University Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC). He has served in various command and staff positions in the Estonian Defence Forces, as well as been deployed to Afghanistan in 2006 and Mali 2013-2014. While working at the Headquarters of the Estonian Defence Forces, he has participated in advance planning for a crisis in the Baltic Sea Region nationally and multinationally as part of the Baltic Combined Joint Staff Element.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This in-person event is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/RXFNcg1yoU2vbUv2A"&gt;Registration is required.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Patrick McCray, "README: A Bookish History of Computing from Electronic Brains to Everything Machines" at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming Patrick McCray to talk about his latest book, &lt;i&gt;README: A Bookish History of Computing from Electronic Brains to Everything Machines&lt;/i&gt;, on January 21, 2026, at 4:00 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;README&lt;/i&gt;, historian Patrick McCray argues that in order for computers to become ubiquitous, people first had to become interested in them, learn about them, and take the machines seriously. A powerful catalyst for this transformation was, ironically, one of the oldest information technologies we have: books. The author uses a carefully chosen selection of books, some iconic and others obscure, to describe this technological revolution as it unfolded in the half century after 1945. The book begins with a fundamental question: How does a new technology become well-known and widespread? McCray answers this by using books as a window into significant moments in the history of computing, books, publishing, and American culture.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;README&lt;/i&gt; offers a literary history of computers and, more broadly, information technologies between World War II and the dot.com crash of the early twenty-first century. From the electronic brains and cybernetics craze of the 1940s to the birth of AI, the rise of the personal computer, and the Internet-driven financial frenzy of the 1990s, books have proven a durable and essential way for people to learn how to use and think about computers. By offering a readable half-century of bookish history, &lt;i&gt;README &lt;/i&gt;explains how computers became popular and pervasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.amosgitai.com/html/page.asp?docid=2&amp;amp;lang=1"&gt;Amos Gitai&lt;/a&gt;, filmmaker and artist&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://dlcl.stanford.edu/people/vered-karti-shemtov"&gt;Vered Shemtov&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Lecturer in Comparative Literature, Stanford University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to the public, but registration is required to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second film screening in the Amos Gitai Film Festival will feature the "powerful, political, and provocative," &lt;i&gt;Rabin, The Last Day&lt;/i&gt; (2015) on Tuesday, January 27, 2026 in the Hauck Auditorium, Traitel Building. &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/amos-gitai-film-festival-part-2-rabin-the-last-day-screening-and-panel-discussion"&gt;More details on the event and registration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Film Synopsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;House&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gitai's first film, House (1980), is about a house in West Jerusalem that belonged to a Palestinian family until 1948. The film traces the succession of its owners and residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 1948 war, the Dajani family left their home, and the Israeli government housed Algerian Jewish immigrants, the Toboul family, there. At the end of the 70’s a renowned Israeli economist bought the house and the Tobouls were relocated to public housing, on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Now, the new owner wants to transform this house into a three-story villa. To do so, he has to bring stones from a quarry south of the West Bank, and Palestinian workers from refugee camps around Hebron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This house is therefore the subject of this documentary, which offers a series of biographical fragments. It’s a kind of microcosm, a metaphor for Jerusalem, with its human archaeological layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Filmmaker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMOS GITAI is an artist and filmmaker. He was born in Haifa, Israel, in 1950 to Munio Weinraub, an architect trained at the Bauhaus, and Efratia Margalit, an intellectual and teacher. He holds a Ph.D. in Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally known for his documentaries and feature films about the Middle East, the Arab Israeli conflict, and personal and collective memory, Gitai was wounded during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, when a medical evacuation helicopter in which he was travelling was hit by a Syrian missile. He has drawn on biographical, familial and generational themes throughout his career, as well as the trauma of war and the celebration of life in the face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Gitai has created over ninety films, spanning a wide variety of formats including feature-length and short films, fiction and documentaries, experimental works, television productions, and also installations or theater plays. His work has been presented in several major retrospectives around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Amos Gitai Archive at Stanford&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past nine years, Stanford University Libraries has been steadily collecting the archives of Amos Gitai’s work, both documentary and fiction, including the House documentary trilogy: House (1980), A House in Jerusalem (1998), News from Home / News from House (2005); the border trilogy: Promised Land (Terre promise) (2004), Free Zone (2005), Disengagement (2007); and two films centered on the Holocaust : One Day You’ll Understand (Plus tard tu comprendras) (2008) and Tsili (2014), both adaptations of literary works. More recently, the collection was expanded to include Gitai’s theater adaptation of the House trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanning more than forty years of work and representing ten and a half terabytes of data, this collection offers exceptional access to the creative process of a world-renowned artist—one who feels at home in the fields of cinema, architecture, theater, and art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view some of the Gitai Archive on display in the current &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/amos-gitai-archive-at-stanford"&gt;Gitai exhibit in the Cecil H. Green Library&lt;/a&gt; on campus, available for viewing until February 15, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amos Gitai Publications Available for Purchase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford University Libraries is pleased to publish two books in conjunction with this event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Yitzhak Rabin: Chronicle of an Assassination&lt;/i&gt; by Amos Gitai is &lt;a href="https://publications.library.stanford.edu/catalog"&gt;available for purchase&lt;/a&gt; from Tuesday, December 9, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Amos Gitai and the Challenge of Archives&lt;/i&gt;, edited by Amos Gitai and Jean-Michel Frodon, will be published in January 2026.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both books will be available for purchase at the event. Together, these books introduce American audiences to Amos Gitai’s decades-spanning oeuvre grappling with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the place of the arts in engaging with that conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

The Data Library is a project that aims to capture, curate, and share biological data generated on campus — enabling data search, exploration, visualization and cross-project analyses through a series of applications in available via a web browser. Dr. Fragiadakis received her Ph.D. and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, and joined the faculty of the UCSF’s Department of Medicine, Division of Rheumatology in 2019. She is a member of the Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Informatics Graduate Programs, the Bakar ImmunoX Initiative, the Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine, and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute. She leads a computational immunology lab studying states of the human immune system across disease contexts using single-cell methods and data integration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16px;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16px;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Bay Area Open Science Group&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://bayareaopensciencegroup.github.io/"&gt;Bay Area Open Science Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a growing community for Bay Area academics and researchers interested in incorporating open science into their research, teaching, and learning. Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Film Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rabin The Last Day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the evening of Saturday, November 4, 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Nobel and Nobel Peace Prize winner Yitzhak Rabin is shot down with three bullets at the end of a huge rally for peace and against violence in the center of Tel Aviv. His killer, apprehended at the scene, turns out to be a twenty-five-year-old student and observant Jew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature film shot twenty years after Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination sheds light what made this tragic deed possible: A culture of hate fueled by hysterical rhetoric, paranoia, and political intrigue. The extremist rabbis who condemned Rabin by invoking an obscure religious ruling. The prominent rightwing politicians who joined in a campaign of incitement against Rabin. The militant Israeli settlers for whom peace meant betrayal. And the security agents who saw what was coming and failed to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Filmmaker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMOS GITAI is an artist and filmmaker. He was born in Haifa, Israel, in 1950 to Munio Weinraub, an architect trained at the Bauhaus, and Efratia Margalit, an intellectual and teacher. He holds a Ph.D. in Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally known for his documentaries and feature films about the Middle East, the Arab Israeli conflict, and personal and collective memory, Gitai was wounded during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, when a medical evacuation helicopter in which he was travelling was hit by a Syrian missile. He has drawn on biographical, familial and generational themes throughout his career, as well as the trauma of war and the celebration of life in the face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Gitai has created over ninety films, spanning a wide variety of formats including feature-length and short films, fiction and documentaries, experimental works, television productions, and also installations or theater plays. His work has been presented in several major retrospectives around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Amos Gitai Archive at Stanford&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past nine years, Stanford University Libraries has been steadily collecting the archives of Amos Gitai’s work, both documentary and fiction, including the House documentary trilogy: House (1980), A House in Jerusalem (1998), News from Home / News from House (2005); the border trilogy: Promised Land (Terre promise) (2004), Free Zone (2005), Disengagement (2007); and two films centered on the Holocaust : One Day You’ll Understand (Plus tard tu comprendras) (2008) and Tsili (2014), both adaptations of literary works. More recently, the collection was expanded to include Gitai’s theater adaptation of the House trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanning more than forty years of work and representing ten and a half terabytes of data, this collection offers exceptional access to the creative process of a world-renowned artist—one who feels at home in the fields of cinema, architecture, theater, and art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view some of the Gitai Archive on display in the current &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/amos-gitai-archive-at-stanford"&gt;Gitai exhibit in the Cecil H. Green Library&lt;/a&gt; on campus, available for viewing until February 15, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amos Gitai Publications Available for Purchase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanford University Libraries is pleased to publish two books in conjunction with this event. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Yitzhak Rabin: Chronicle of an Assassination&lt;/i&gt; by Amos Gitai is &lt;a href="https://publications.library.stanford.edu/catalog"&gt;available for purchase&lt;/a&gt; from Tuesday, December 9, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Amos Gitai and the Challenge of Archives&lt;/i&gt;, edited by Amos Gitai and Jean-Michel Frodon, will be published in January 2026.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both books will be available for purchase at the event. Together, these books introduce American audiences to Amos Gitai’s decades-spanning oeuvre grappling with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the place of the arts in engaging with that conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BioBlitz 2026</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/stanford-love-data-week-2026-bioblitz"&gt;Join us for a BioBlitz!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bioblitz is a community event to observe and record as many species as possible within a specific location and time period. As part of Love Data Week, we'll be using iNaturalist to gather information on our local biodiversity - around Stanford and the Hopkins Marine Station - to better understand the plants, animals, and critters that share the campus with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure where to start, check out some of the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://community.stanford.edu/explore-campus/campus-walks"&gt;themed walks and trails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; on campus. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intro to Python (for AI-Assisted Coding) at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Learn to read and understand Python code in the age of AI-assisted programming. This hands-on workshop introduces how programming languages work and develops your ability to recognize common Python patterns, from variables and functions to loops and conditionals. You’ll learn Python syntax and practice code literacy: understanding what code does and how to effectively leverage Gen AI models via Stanford AI Playground to generate and modify Python code for data cleaning and analysis. Through practical exercises, you'll learn to write clear prompts, interpret AI-generated code, and verify its correctness. By the end of this session, you'll have the foundational knowledge needed to use AI tools to create code for data-related tasks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Date and Time: 3:00–4:30PM, Thursday, February 5, 2026&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redistricting 101: California’s Prop 50 and beyond!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Join the Stanford Libraries for an interactive redistricting mapping workshop during Love Data Week! On Tuesday Nov. 4th, California’s voters weighed in on &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/quick-reference-guide/50.htm" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Proposition 50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a state constitutional amendment to modify Congressional district maps. Come on by our hands-on workshop on how to make your own mathematically-sound redistricting map. What does democratic representation look like? The choice is yours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will be using online cartographic tools like &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://davesredistricting.org/" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;DRA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/b&gt;(Dave’s Redistricting) and &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://planscore.org/upload.html" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;PlanScore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to draw and evaluate voting district maps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Guest speaker &lt;b&gt;Mike Migurski &lt;/b&gt;will share how PlanScore participates in the redistricting process!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Please &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://appointments.library.stanford.edu/event/15881427"&gt;register here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn about: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proposition 50: The Election Rigging Response Act &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measures of fairness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Census Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Partisan versus independent redistricting commissions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Resilient Expression: Ukrainian Artists in Estonia at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for a film screening and discussion with Stanford alumnus and Fulbright Student researcher Parker Watt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resilient Expression: Ukrainian Artists in Estonia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this event, Stanford alumnus and Fulbright Student researcher Parker Watt will present his documentary series, “Resilient Expression: Ukrainian Artists in Estonia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Estonia has been a leader in providing refuge to the Ukrainian people. At the start of the war, Estonia accepted the most Ukrainians per capita of any country in the world, and it remains among the top three, behind Czechia and Poland. There are now approximately 60,000 Ukrainians in Estonia, representing about 4.4% of the population. Three-quarters of these Ukrainians have arrived since 2022. These individuals must negotiate how to maintain their cultural identity while integrating and building new lives abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian artists play a critical role in cultural preservation for the Ukrainian community in Estonia. Their work draws on traditions from the past, reflects their experience in the present, and defines what Ukrainian culture is for the future as their homeland is under attack. As they establish themselves, their work creates spaces for healing and helps them to connect with Estonian people and culture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parker Watt created this series of short films over the past year to highlight personal stories that can be abstracted when discussing the events of war and their effects in the media. Each video tells the story of a single Ukrainian artist or artistic group living and working in Estonia and focuses on how their work serves as a mode of healing, cultural continuation, and integration in Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was made possible by the Fulbright Student Research Grant as well as the Association for the Advancement of Baltic Studies’ Baumanis Grant for Creative Projects in Baltic Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A discussion with the author will follow the screening. Opening remarks will be delivered by &lt;b&gt;Ivo Lille&lt;/b&gt;, Director of the Vabamu Museum of Occupation and Freedom (Tallinn, Estonia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parker Watt &lt;/b&gt;is passionate about finding the human stories in international events and introducing them through film. While in Estonia, he was affiliated with the Johan Skytte Institute of Political Studies at the University of Tartu, where he continued to write and speak on developments in the Baltic region and the United States. His previous film experience includes serving as an Assistant to the Director on two independent professional film sets and as a Production Assistant on the Netflix series &lt;/i&gt;Pieces of Her&lt;i&gt;. Before his Fulbright project, Parker received his Bachelor of Arts in International Relations and a minor in Slavic Languages and Literature from Stanford. He was first introduced to Estonia through the Stanford Global Studies internship in Estonia. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This in-person event is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/UVweZK6RE5xzKAwh6"&gt;Registration is required.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>50 Years of Solar Data at Stanford</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Stanford’s Wilcox Solar Observatory, located just south of the main campus, began collecting daily observations of the Sun's magnetic field in May 1975 with the goal of understanding changes in the Sun and how those changes affect the Earth. Twenty years later, in December 1995, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) launched, carrying the Michelson Doppler Imager, an instrument that measures magnetic fields in the photosphere, that was designed and operated by Stanford’s solar group. Continuing Stanford’s long history of studying our nearest star, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched on February 11, 2010, bringing with it the ability to photograph the sun almost constantly without interference from Earth’s atmosphere. Every day, data from SDO are processed, analyzed, and made available to the public from the Joint Science Operations Center, which is housed here on Stanford’s campus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Instructors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt; Alex Koufos, Philip Mansfield, Charles Baldner, Cristina Rabello Soares, Arthur Amezcua&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Organizer: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Katie Frey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Writing a Research Proposal? Learn about the Stanford IRB process with Michael Levesque at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Gear Up for Social Science Data:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Come meet Michael Levesque from the Stanford IRB office to learn more about research proposals that include human subjects (non-medical) and the process for when you might need the IRB to review your research plan. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee that reviews and approves research involving human subjects to ensure it is ethical and protects participants' rights and welfare. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2026 Wikidata Edit-a-thon at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wikidata.org/"&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt; is an open, multilingual structured knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines and is made by people like you. Digital assistants like &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q582159"&gt;Siri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28022144"&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; use Wikidata, as do search engines like &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9366"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. You can think of Wikidata as a database of databases, linking items through identifiers. This creates a centralized location of information about anything and everything: from the &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184067"&gt;pika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3141050"&gt;Chicago-style hot dog&lt;/a&gt;. With over &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:Statistics"&gt;114,683,910&lt;/a&gt; data &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Help:Items"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, there’s likely to be an item for your favorite band, and your birthplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Join us online and in person for an introduction to Wikidata followed by a Wikidata Edit-a-thon! Learn more about Wikidata’s impact, how to make edits, create references, and query Wikidata in this 2-hour hands-on session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wednesday, February 11, 11am – 1pm &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In-person, IC Classroom, Green Library and on Zoom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://appointments.library.stanford.edu/event/15884960"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Register for Event&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Spots are open to current Stanford Affiliates only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount"&gt;create an account&lt;/a&gt; in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of  &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/"&gt;a series of workshops for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build a No-Code Personal Image Reference Collection with IIIF at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;In this workshop participants will create simple, no-code digital collections of images of maps and other cultural heritage objects for use in research and teaching. Drawing from disparate sources including Stanford's Searchworks catalog, DavidRumsey.com, the Library of Congress website, and the Internet Archive, participants will use the Mixtape webapp to assemble custom sets of images via IIIF manifests. Students will be familiarized with basic concepts related to IIIF (the International Image Interoperability Framework), learn to locate IIIF manifests for cultural heritage images in online archives, create a first collection using Mixtape, and view examples of ways Mixtape galleries can be integrated into other resources, including Canvas and GitHub Pages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exploring Solar Data with SunPy and NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;A workshop on SunPy, a Python library for finding and using solar data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This workshop will focus on using SunPy, a community-developed, free, and open-source software package for solar physics, to find and use data from Stanford’s Joint Science Operations Center, the hub for data from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite. This workshop will include an introduction to concepts in solar physics along with the SunPy Python package and is open to everyone regardless of scientific background.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.5pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;During this workshop, we will learn how to use SunPy to find and download solar data. We will look at sunspots and solar flares, see the connection between these phenomena and solar magnetic fields, and see how events in the solar atmosphere give rise to geomagnetic storms that affect us here on Earth. Participants are expected to be comfortable with Python fundamentals, such as variable assignment, functions, loops, and lists. Learning SunPy will give you the ability to see for yourself how our own star changes over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Relax with Data Crafts: Love Data Week De-stress! at Mitchell Earth Sciences</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Take a moment to relax with snacks, crafts, and games at Branner Earth Sciences Library! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This event is part of &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at Stanford, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. So grab a coffee while you create your own data inspired crafts!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Available activities:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI APIs &amp;amp; Astronomy Imagery &lt;/b&gt;- Compare real astronomical photos from Astronomy Picture of the Day (APoD) with AI images we generate on demand for you from Stanford's AI Playground API. Check out &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/ai-astronomy-imagery/exhibits" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;last year's gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Map Embroidery &lt;/b&gt;- Make a meaningful map in this data physicalization activity! We provide the raw materials for you to embroider a personal mini-map, you bring the creativity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Textile Data Weaving&lt;/b&gt; - You’re probably used to seeing data represented in charts and graphs, but have you ever seen a data set turned into a textile? With this activity, you can weave a data set into cloth to destress and learn a fun method of displaying data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guess the Dataset!&lt;/b&gt; - Try to guess the underlying dataset from an unlabeled graph. This is a fun way to put your knowledge of trends in the world to the test. We'll put it up on a bit screen so you can play with your friends, and maybe make some new friends! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;All activities are free, no experience necessary (we'll show you how!), and will be available while supplies last!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Help us reduce waste, bring your own covered mug and reusable plate!&lt;br&gt;
Branner Library will also be hosting several data inspired events throughout the day, be sure to check them out!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please bring your Stanford ID card/mobile ID to enter the library, visitors must present their government issued ID at the front desk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dask for Geospatial Analysis: Efficient Parallel Workflows for Satellite Imagery in Sherlock at Mitchell Earth Sciences</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This workshop will provide an introduction to Dask in Python for satellite image analysis on distributed systems at scale. We will learn workflows for accessing Earth Observation satellite imagery from NASA as we learn to interact efficiently with images that are larger than the onboard memory of a single chip, build and run custom functions targeted at only the pixels needed for our analysis goals, and process targeted, machine learning ready datasets from these images with the help of Dask's parallelization and distributed data capabilities. This workshop is aimed at researchers who have intermediate Python experience or higher, and all levels of experience (beginner-advanced) with HPC computing. Access to Sherlock is required to participate fully in the session. This workshop is offered in partnership with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://sdss-compute.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;u style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the SDSS Center for Computation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2026 Wikidata Edit-a-thon: Performers from the Piano Roll Archive</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In part two of our LDW Wikidata Edit-a-thon series, participants will do a deep dive into one of Stanford’s collections: the Piano Roll Archive, part of the Archive of Recorded Sound. Participants will add metadata about piano roll performers to Wikidata. A brief overview of Wikidata will be provided before learning about this unique Stanford collection, and how it benefits from discovery in Wikidata, an open, multilingual structured knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines and is made by people like you. We will learn and discuss the collection, review relevant data as a group, and then edit and add to Wikidata in this 2-hour hands-on session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friday, February 13, 2026, 11am - 1pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In-person, IC Classroom, Green Library, and on Zoom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://appointments.library.stanford.edu/event/15884999"&gt;Register for the event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Spots are open to current Stanford Affiliates only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount"&gt;create an account&lt;/a&gt; in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/"&gt;a series of workshops for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. &lt;/p&gt;
