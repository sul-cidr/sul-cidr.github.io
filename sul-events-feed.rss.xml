      <title>Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the essence, and the form fades away at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;청계 차일수: 득의망상 (得意忘象)&lt;br&gt;
Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the Essence, and the Form Fades Away&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stanford East Asia Library presents an exhibition by the South Korean artist Cheonggea Ilsu Cha from November 18, 2024 to February 20, 2025. Artist Cha has dedicated his 40-year career to the mastery of ‘literati’ painting.  The literati genre combines written word with a painterly interpretation of text, a form of art that has been practiced by the scholarly elite in Korea for over 400 years. His work has been featured at the prestigious Grand Art Exhibition of Korea, and he has held eight solo exhibitions.&lt;br&gt;
A significant number of Korean scholars practiced literati painting during the Joseon Dynasty, which extended from 1392 to 1897. Literati painting reflects the scholar’s observation, understanding and interpretation of a poetic topic. The artist strives for aesthetic discipline; the text must be no longer than what the topic minimally requires. So too must the artist seek simplicity in his visual vocabulary.  The exhibition is inspired by the philosophy of Tŭgŭi mangsang (得意忘象), which emphasizes abandoning artifice in order to seek the true nature of things.  The works at the exhibition employ the use of ink and a constrained palette of color using materials such as traditional Korean paper, scrolls, and fans. The paintings touch on a wide variety of topics, from nature to philosophical reflections to expressions of human emotion. Cha’s work is inspired by the artistic sensibility of his predecessors. Visitors to the museum will find paintings imbued with a classic aesthetic, timeless charm, and a lively wit.&lt;br&gt;
This exhibition of Cha’s Korean literati paintings was curated by Jee-Young Park, Korean Studies Librarian at Stanford East Asia Library; Ji Soo Kim, M.A. in  Museum Studies from San Francisco State University; and Wooju Chong, M. A. in Center for East Asian Studies from Stanford University, in consultation with the East Asia Library Exhibits Committee.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: Authenticity by Design at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet is at an inflection point. With the growth of artificial intelligence and synthetic media, trust in information faces unprecedented threats. Authenticity is not guaranteed. At the same time, new technologies–referred to as “Web 3”–present opportunities to protect the integrity of data. These solutions can be applied to critical practices including investigative journalism, historical archiving, and the admissibility of legal evidence. This exhibit, curated by the &lt;a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/"&gt;Starling Lab for Data Integrity&lt;/a&gt;, asks: How might we design information systems for authenticity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/visitor-access" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epicenters: Navigating Recovery and Renewal from Disasters at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;In the wake of disaster, maps play many roles, shaping understanding of the event in the immediate aftermath, serving as visceral portrayals for those who were not there, and communicating both scale and extent of the tragedy. They gavanize support for rebuilding by showing new possible futures and can be used to memorialize the event, inscribing the memory over the landscape. Drawing upon sources from historical representations to contemporary satellite imagery, the maps in this exhibition explore various ways communities use maps to make sense of calamity and move forward from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;The exhibition was curated by Stanford student Muhammad Dhafer, winner of the 2024 California Map Society student exhibition competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This exhibition is ongoing and will be available until February 28th, 2024. To view the exhibit, visit the David Rumsey Map Center during its public drop-in hours.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Erik Baker in conversation with Kathryn Olivarius and Pedro Regalado on, "Make Your Own Job: How the Entrepreneurial Work Ethic Exhausted America" at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming Harvard historian Erik Baker for a conversation with Stanford historians Pedro Regalado and Kathryn Olivarius. The three will discuss Baker’s newly published book, &lt;i&gt;Make Your Own Job: How the Entrepreneurial Work Ethic Exhausted America &lt;/i&gt;on February 6, 2025. The book just received a rave &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/02/03/make-your-own-job-erik-baker-book-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674293601" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A copy can be purchased here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Americans think about work changed profoundly over the course of the twentieth century. Thrift and persistence came to seem old-fashioned. Successful workers were increasingly expected to show initiative and enthusiasm for change—not just to do their jobs reliably but to create new opportunities for themselves and for others. Our culture of work today is more demanding than ever, even though workers haven't seen commensurate rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make Your Own Job&lt;/i&gt; explains how this entrepreneurial work ethic took hold, from its origins in late nineteenth-century success literature to the gig economy of today, sweeping in strange bedfellows: Marcus Garvey and Henry Ford, Avon ladies and New Age hippies. Business schools and consultants exhorted managers to cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit in their subordinates, while an industry of self-help authors synthesized new ideas from psychology into a vision of work as “self-realization.” Policy experts embraced the new ethic as a remedy for urban and Third World poverty. Every social group and political tendency, it seems, has had its own exemplary entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historian Erik Baker argues that the entrepreneurial work ethic has given meaning to work in a world where employment is ever more precarious––and in doing so, has helped legitimize a society of mounting economic insecurity and inequality. From the advent of corporate capitalism in the Gilded Age to the economic stagnation of recent decades, Americans have become accustomed to the reality that today’s job may be gone tomorrow. Where work is hard to find and older nostrums about diligent effort fall flat, the advice to “make your own job” keeps hope alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erik Baker &lt;/b&gt;is a lecturer in the History of Science Department and the director of the senior thesis program for the History &amp;amp; Science concentration. He received his PhD from Harvard and his BA from Northwestern University. His book project, &lt;i&gt;Make Your Own Job: The Entrepreneurial Work Ethic in Modern America&lt;/i&gt;, explores the role of popular psychologists and management experts in transforming beliefs about work and success in the twentieth-century United States. He has published on the history of social science and American capitalism in Modern Intellectual History, History of the Human Sciences, and Studies in History and Philosophy of Science. He also writes widely for magazines such as &lt;i&gt;n+1, The Baffler, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thedriftmag.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Drift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, where he is an associate editor.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Love Data Week 2025 BioBlitz</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This workshop is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/"&gt;a series of workshops for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generating and Using Biodiversity Big Data is a multipart activity that begins with a virtual workshop on locating, downloading, and cleaning biodiversity data for research. Following the workshop, participants will be invited to join an asynchronous &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/stanford-love-data-week-2025-bioblitz"&gt;Bioblitz&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/"&gt;iNaturalist platform&lt;/a&gt; to generate biodiversity data that will be shared with the open data repository GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). Participants will learn how to search for data of interest, learn about some of the caveats of using biodiversity big data, how to clean and properly attribute data, and will also contribute data themselves by participating in a week-long Bioblitz across Stanford campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monday, February 10, 1-2:30pm PT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wikidata Edit-a-thon at IC Classroom, Green Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of  &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/"&gt;a series of workshops for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wikidata.org/"&gt;Wikidata&lt;/a&gt; is an open, multilingual structured knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines and is made by people like you. Digital assistants like &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q582159"&gt;Siri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28022144"&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt; use Wikidata, as do search engines like &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9366"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. You can think of Wikidata as a database of databases, linking items through identifiers. This creates a centralized location of information about anything and everything: from the &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q184067"&gt;pika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q316"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3141050"&gt;Chicago-style hot dog&lt;/a&gt;. With over &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:Statistics"&gt;114,683,910&lt;/a&gt; data &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Help:Items"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;, there’s likely to be an item for your favorite band, and your birthplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Join us online and in person for an introduction to Wikidata followed by a Wikidata Edit-a-thon! Learn more about Wikidata’s impact, how to make edits, create references, and query Wikidata in this 2-hour hands-on session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tuesday, February 11, 11am – 1pm &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In-person, IC Classroom, Green Library and on Zoom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://goto.stanford.edu/wikidata"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Register for Event&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;goto.stanford.edu/wikidata. &lt;/b&gt;Spots are open to current Stanford Affiliates only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href="https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:CreateAccount"&gt;create an account&lt;/a&gt; in advance, and enroll in the &lt;a href="https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/Stanford_University/LDW_Wikidata_Edit-a-thon?enroll=yugnhepj"&gt;Edit-a-thon Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; to track our edits during Love Data Week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For those attending the in-person workshop, please bring your Stanford ID card/mobile ID to enter the library. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Carpentries @ Stanford: Data Visualization in R</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;This is part of a series of workshops for &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu"&gt;Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities, and services relevant to data in research.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
This workshop is an introduction to working with data visualization in R for those who have moderate programming experience in R. If you know how to work with datasets (variables, matrices, dataframes) and functions in R, but you have never created figures beyond maybe a few base R visualizations (using the plot, hist, barplot functions), then this class is a good fit for you! By the end of this workshop, you will have learned the syntax of ggplot2, how to modify and customize graph aesthetics, how to generate common plots, and how to save your figures to your computer. Time permitting, we will explore a few extra features such as faceting, custom colors, and themes!&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Register &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1alkaw991YYyVmSyri_7M9meo8poib_6Je1XsFIBWN3hhUg/viewform"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to attend. Spots are open to current Stanford Affiliates only and will be offered on a first-come, first-serve basis. Space is limited, and a waitlist will be available once all spots are filled. (Please note: You must be logged in to Google Drive with your Stanford email, such as &lt;a href="mailto:YourSUNetid@stanford.edu"&gt;YourSUNetid@stanford.edu&lt;/a&gt;, to access the registration form.)&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Location: Virtual (A zoom link will be sent to registrants one week before the event.)&lt;br&gt;
Date and Time: 1:00PM - 4:00PM, Tuesday, February 11, 2025&lt;br&gt;
Lead Instructor: Dr. Alma Parada, Head Librarian, Earth Sciences Library&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
This session will not be recorded, but lesson materials will be shared with participants after the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop is an introduction to methods of API authentication, with a focus on different approaches for securely storing API credentials and how to avoid publishing them online by accident.  We will cover common types of authentication systems that someone may encounter when using APIs for research purposes, such as API keys, Bearer tokens, and Basic Authentication. Basic boilerplate scripts will be provided in Python and R that can be used to authenticate with these kinds of APIs. The workshop will also discuss general pointers on how to obtain API keys and tokens. Attendees to this workshop should have familiarity with Python or R. There may be portions of the workshop that you will want to follow along with on your own computer if you have Python or R installed, but this is not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Location: Zoom (Please register &lt;a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/IflvKiwmRsqzcm2GzMKj8Q#/registration"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your spot and receive a Zoom link for this workshop!)&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;Take a moment to relax with snacks, crafts, and a guessing game @ Branner Earth Sciences LIbrary! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.sites.stanford.edu/"&gt;Love Data Week at Stanford&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research.  So grab a coffee while you create your own data inspired crafts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;Available activies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make a map without a computer&lt;/b&gt; - Make a meaningful map in this data physicalization activity! We provide the raw materials for you to embroider a personal mini-map, you bring the creativity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Textile Data Weaving&lt;/b&gt; - You’re probably used to seeing data represented in charts and graphs, but have you ever seen a data set turned into a textile? With this activity, you can weave a data set into cloth to destress and learn a fun method of displaying data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Color by Numbers&lt;/b&gt; - Just want to sit and color a cute picture of a kittten in a basket? Make it data inspired! We'll have various color-by-number sheets of cute and science related images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guess the Dataset!&lt;/b&gt; - Try to guess the underlying dataset from an unlabeled graph. This is a fun way to put your knowledge of trends in the world to the test. We'll put it up on a bit screen so you can play with your friends, and maybe make some new friends! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All activities are free, no experience necessary (we'll show you how!), and will be available while supplies last!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Help us reduce waste, bring your own covered mug and reusable plate!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>California Pop-up Exhibit @ Branner Earth Sciences Library at Mitchell Earth Sciences</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Stanford Libraries pop-up exhibits on &lt;b&gt;California&lt;/b&gt;, Branner Earth Sciences Library &amp;amp; Map Collections will be featuring maps, reports, and minerals created as part of the&lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/sgs-collection"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Stanford Geological Survey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, February 13, 2025 from 1-3pm in Branner Library (2nd Floor, Mitchell Earth Sciences Building). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On display will be several items including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/7594435"&gt;Herbert Hoover's student topographic map of the Stanford campus created c. 1893.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5968665"&gt;Report and map by Mary Balch Kennedy (1929)&lt;/a&gt; who was not allowed to attend the required Summer Geology Camp because she was a woman, instead she had to map the geology of the New Almaden Quadrangle alone in rugged terrain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/4793992"&gt;R.B. Marshall's map (1895) covering a large amount, if not all, of the Stanford lands&lt;/a&gt;.  He notes the "marsh line" which extended to present day HIghway 101 as a dotted line across the top section of the map. This may be the only map from this time depicting the marshlands with such detail at this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will also feature several minerals from the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability Specimen Collection, collected during the surveys or in surveyed areas, including Epidote, Gold, Jade, Actinolite, and Quartz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.sites.stanford.edu/"&gt;Love Data Week at Stanford&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using LLMs to Extract Structured Data from PDFs at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger" style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This workshop is part of Stanford's &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Love Data Week 2025&lt;/a&gt;. The topic is the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract structured data from PDFs or other data. Imagine that you have a PDF with some tabular data in it, like a table. You want that data to work in a computable form (like CSV) for use in Excel or other tools. Large language models (LLMs) might be able to help with this task. &lt;a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/service/aiplayground" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;The Stanford AI Playground&lt;/a&gt; provides an easy mechanism to experiment with LLMs to help with data extraction or manipulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger" style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please register &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lPtEvL8wRO6HHYCLkHAXKAdqdtTe54F6i9-qR9aGWnw/viewform?edit_requested=true"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to reserve your spot for this workshop!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabletop Tuesdays: Studying Data with the game Rescue Polar Bears: Data &amp; Temperature at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month's Tabletop Tuesdays is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;a series for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rescue Polar Bears: Data &amp;amp; Temperature is a cooperative game based on Rescue Polar Bears with a new data and temperature system added to the game design to make the strategy more diversified. The consumption of fossil fuel and releasing of greenhouse gases yield the global warming. Around the North Pole, the last icebergs are melting and the polar bears are facing the risk of being extinct. The players form a scientific organization. They try to collect data about climate change to persuade the governments to change their energy policy. At the same time, they also need to prevent polar bears from sinking into the freezing water. Each player drives a rescue ship of different ability to complete the mission on the Arctic Ocean. As long as the players collectively gather enough data, they win together. However, if too many polar bears sink into the water, everyone loses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabletop Tuesdays is an event series held on the third Tuesday of each month. At these events, we feature a selection of board games and collection items from across SUL's holdings around a specific theme. Drop in to learn about the month's featured game(s) and/or try some of the board games we have for open play at the Silicon Valley Archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ART/WORK at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/special-collections-exhibits"&gt;ART/WORK | Creative Pursuits of Stanford Libraries Staff&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; on view February 20, 2024, through April 27, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this exhibition, we sought to create a space where staff could share their artistic, creative sides that may not otherwise be a part of their work at Stanford. In the Summer of 2024, Special Collections invited current Stanford Libraries staff to enter creative work in any medium to be considered for a Winter 2025 exhibit in Green Library’s Peterson Gallery and Rotunda. Response to the call for entries was hearty. In addition to traditional fine art techniques of drawing, painting, printmaking, and photography, submissions included mixed media sculpture, ceramics, collage, textiles, and poetry. An anonymous selection committee of library staff blind-reviewed over a hundred entries and chose the fifty works displayed in the galleries. We asked the people whose pieces were selected to write a brief statement to accompany their work in the exhibit and posed several questions for their consideration: Why do creative work? What medium do you work in and why? How did you get started? What does it mean to you to be an artist (if you define yourself as one)? Does art need an audience? Who is your audience? What influences your work, and whose work do you admire? As you will see, Stanford library staff are talented and thoughtful, pursuing many forms of creative work after hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Roberto Trujillo, Associate University Librarian, Director of Special Collections and Frances and Charles Field Curator of Special Collections; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions, with assistance from Elizabeth Fischbach.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their careful consideration of all staff art submissions, we thank the staff members who served on the jury; For their assessment of materials, Aisha Wahab and Beth Ryan in Conservation Services; For their assistance with logistics Ranelle Sharma and Jacob Cohn in Library Facilities, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;
