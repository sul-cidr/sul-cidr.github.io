      <title>Rise Up for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders exhibit</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In response to the precipitous increase in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) hate crimes throughout the United States, the staff of Stanford Libraries created the Rise Up against AAPI exhibit which focuses on the history of systemic racism against the AAPI community. The aim of this exhibit is to help educate our community and provide support and resources so that we can start the process of healing and prevent future incidents. In this exhibit, we discuss past events that have led to these reprehensible acts, including institutionalized policies that have pitted minority groups in our country against each other to weaken the other&amp;#8217;s influence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We hope that through education, our community at large can rise to action against racism at all levels of our society. From the nuanced exclusions on the playground and in the workplace, to the blatant disregard for human life demonstrated in the murders of Asian American women in Atlanta and the brutal attacks on elderly AAPI community members in California and New York&amp;#8212;we must all take an active stand against the scourge that racism is to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This exhibit has both an online and physical presence. You can access the online exhibit at &lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/riseup" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exhibits.stanford.edu/riseup&lt;/a&gt;. The physical exhibit is in the East Asia Library and is a companion to the online exhibit. The physical exhibit highlights material from the Stanford Libraries collection and other sources that illustrate the racial struggle of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community throughout US history. Please note the physical exhibit is only open during the East Asia Library's open hours. Visit &lt;a href="https://library-hours.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;library.stanford.edu/hours&lt;/a&gt; to see current hours.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This exhibit is a work in progress and just the beginning of our efforts to combat racism in this country. Look for expanded content covering more ethnic groups and a broader range of issues as this exhibit continues to grow over the fall 2021 quarter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries stands with the AAPI community and denounces all hate crimes, including the recent surge in hate crimes specifically targeted at the AAPI community. We hope you will join our efforts to learn about the history of violence against the AAPI community so that we can prevent history from repeating itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Say Their Names - No More Names</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Say Their Names &amp;ndash; No More Names&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an online and in-person exhibit that highlights Black Americans who have been killed or impacted by police brutality and systemic racism. The exhibit originated in direct response to the global Black Lives Matter movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical exhibition in Green Library includes names affixed to glass panels in the Bing Wing as well as banners throughout the first floor that contain the names and faces of the featured victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/saytheirnames" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online exhibit&lt;/a&gt; displays the images and individual stories of victims, including Emmett Till, Kalief Browder, Salecia Johnson and Bettie Jones; it also calls attention to events like the Tulsa riots, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the Chicago Police Department Midnight Crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who visit Stanford can also see a large banner featuring the words &amp;#39;Know Justice Know Peace,&amp;#39; which was hung on the front entrance of Green Library commemorating the opening of the exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note the physical exhibit in Green Library is currently limited to authorized Stanford ID cardholders due to COVID-19.&amp;nbsp; However, the online exhibit, which also includes photos of the physical exhibit is available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibit is sponsored by the Stanford Libraries and is a follow up to a &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/node/171904" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement of solidarity and support&lt;/a&gt; against systemic racism published by Stanford Libraries over the summer. It offers opportunities for learning, reflection and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Under-Mapped Spaces Public Lecture 2: American Imaginaries after Cartography</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"If Englande crie out, this Norumbega offreth the remedie": American Imaginaries after Cartography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Hakluyt's early modern propagandizing for English colonization in North America depended on the availability of printed matter: maps, narratives, and images. Using the 2018 French historical graphic novel &lt;em&gt;Florida&lt;/em&gt; by Jean Dytar and its depiction of Hakluyt, Sá Pereira considers the imaginary that the novel's geographical history creates. Yet in 2022, after the various spatial turns, can we even speak of an American imaginary outside of the rigid forms of the cartographic ideal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moacir P. de Sá Pereira is the Research Data Librarian at Columbia University Libraries.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lecture will take place &lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, March 1, 2022 &lt;/strong&gt;on Zoom and follows the schedule below: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:45 p.m. PST&lt;/strong&gt;: Zoom opens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:00 p.m. PST&lt;/strong&gt;: Lecture by Moacir P. de Sá Pereira&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The event is free but please &lt;a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_TwwthxHxS56zn1-I1t9EeQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;register here&lt;/a&gt; to get your zoom link.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Under-Mapped Spaces Public Lecture 3: Community ownership and open data: where is the balance? </title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open data is integral to the work of scholarship, but openness can easily turn into an extractive exercise that enforces exploitative dynamics. What considerations do people working with open data have to take into account while working with open spatial data?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Majd Al-Shihabi is a technologist and urban planner, and a PhD student in the geography department at the University of Toronto. Majd's current research is on the use of agent-based modelling to address the wicked problem of the housing crisis, and is the co-founder of Palestine Open Maps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lecture will take place &lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, March 2, 2022 &lt;/strong&gt;on Zoom and follows the schedule below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:45 p.m. PST&lt;/strong&gt;: Zoom opens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:00 p.m. PST&lt;/strong&gt;: Lecture by Majd al-Shihabi&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The event is free but you need to &lt;a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_oMXFRxJSSj-3GxJf-zfuKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;register here&lt;/a&gt; to get your zoom link.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Under-Mapped Spaces Public Lecture 4: Mapping the Gap: Intersections, Counter-Surveillance...</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mapping the Gap: Intersections, Counter-Surveillance and the Mapping Divide &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be it due to lack of training, censorship or differences in infrastructure, not everyone in the world has access to mapping, despite the accessibility of off-the-shelf tools online. At the same time, the possibilities and challenges for mapping grow as we become increasingly aware of the gaps in the historical and cultural record, and the question of mapping absence takes center stage in mapping and scholarly communities. In this lecture, Alex Gil will thread through a selection of web visualizations and maps in order to shed light on the conditions for cartographic creativity in an uneven, broken world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex is the Digital Scholarship Librarian at Columbia University, where he collaborates with faculty, students and library colleagues in humanities research, pedagogy and knowledge production that involves the use of advanced computation, digital media design, and network technologies. He is the lead coordinator for the &lt;a href="https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/" rel="noopener"&gt;Butler Library Studio&lt;/a&gt; at Columbia University Libraries, a tech-light library space focused on digital scholarship and pedagogy, and now a broadcast, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/culstudio" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.twitch.tv/culstudio" rel="noopener"&gt;Studio Remote&lt;/a&gt;. He is also co-founder and moderator of &lt;a href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/" rel="noopener"&gt;Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities&lt;/a&gt;, a trans-disciplinary research cluster focused on experimental humanities; one of the creators and main editors of &lt;a href="http://archipelagosjournal.org/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://archipelagosjournal.org/" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;archipelagos journal: a journal of Caribbean digital praxis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and co-wrangler of its sister conference series, &lt;a href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/" target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/" rel="noopener"&gt;The Caribbean Digital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lecture will take place &lt;strong&gt;Thursday, March 3, 2022&lt;/strong&gt; on Zoom and follows the schedule below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:45 p.m. PST:&lt;/strong&gt; Zoom opens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:00 p.m. PST:&lt;/strong&gt; Lecture by Alexander Gil Fuentes&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The event is free but please &lt;a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_tbi6FSumSv2OHiwgv4rWSw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;register here&lt;/a&gt; to get your zoom link.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
