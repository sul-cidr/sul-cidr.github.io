      <title>Translating Three Japanese Masters, Yumiko Kurahashi, Ryuichi Tamura, and Kazuko Shiraishi: Selections from the Yumiko Tsumura Collection at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On display at the East Asia Library from 3/6/25-5/13/25, selections from a recent donation from Yumiko Tsumura, a local poet and translator, related to three major modern Japanese authors, Yumiko Kurahashi, Ryuichi Tamura and Kazuko Shiraishi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yumiko Kurahashi‚Äôs meteoric career began with &lt;i&gt;Parutai&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;The Party&lt;/i&gt;), a brilliant satire of the Japanese leftist students movement that she wrote while still a student. As part of a first generation of women writers who had benefited from equal opportunity for education in the post-war period, her innovative writing style, influenced by Satre, Kafka, and Camus, rocked the literary world of the 1960s, exposing structural inequities in Japanese society. Perhaps the most renowned post-WWII Japanese poet, Ryuichi Tamura‚Äôs poetry searingly reveals the agony of war and the disorientation induced by rapid modernization. Kazuko Shiraishi, known for performing her provocative poetry to jazz accompaniment, has been called the ‚ÄúAllen Ginsberg of Japan.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to introduce this donation in an exhibit in our main exhibit space. Please visit the East Asia Library to learn more about these three authors, who each left a powerful critique of the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ART/WORK at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/special-collections-exhibits"&gt;ART/WORK | Creative Pursuits of Stanford Libraries Staff&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; on view February 20, 2024, through April 27, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this exhibition, we sought to create a space where staff could share their artistic, creative side that may not otherwise be a part of their work at Stanford. In the Summer of 2024, Special Collections invited current Stanford Libraries staff to enter creative work in any medium to be considered for a Winter 2025 exhibit in Green Library‚Äôs Peterson Gallery and Rotunda. Response to the call for entries was hearty. In addition to traditional fine art techniques of drawing, painting, printmaking, and photography, submissions included mixed media sculpture, ceramics, collage, textiles, and poetry. An anonymous selection committee of library staff blind-reviewed over a hundred entries and chose the fifty works displayed in the galleries. We asked the people whose pieces were selected to write a brief statement to accompany their work in the exhibit and posed several questions for their consideration: Why do creative work? What medium do you work in and why? How did you get started? What does it mean to you to be an artist (if you define yourself as one)? Does art need an audience? Who is your audience? What influences your work, and whose work do you admire? As you will see, Stanford library staff are talented and thoughtful, pursuing many forms of creative work after hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Roberto Trujillo, Associate University Librarian, Director of Special Collections and Frances and Charles Field Curator of Special Collections; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions, with assistance from Elizabeth Fischbach. ¬†Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their careful consideration of all staff art submissions, we thank the staff members who served on the jury; For their assessment of materials, Aisha Wahab and Beth Ryan in Conservation Services; For their assistance with logistics Ranelle Sharma and Jacob Cohn in Library Facilities, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the¬†&lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Library Hours page¬†&lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Right to Privacy: Lowry Pressly in Conversation with Alexander Nemerov at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming Lowry Pressly for a conversation with Alexander Nemerov. The two will discuss Pressly's newly published book,¬†&lt;i&gt;The Right to Oblivion: Privacy and the Good Life&lt;/i&gt;, on April 1, 2025. This event is co-sponsored by the &lt;a href="https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/"&gt;McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society&lt;/a&gt;.¬†¬†&lt;a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674260528"&gt;A copy can be purchased here&lt;/a&gt;.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parts of our lives that are not being surveilled and turned into data diminish each day. We are able to configure privacy settings on our devices and social media platforms, but we know our efforts pale in comparison to the scale of surveillance capitalism and algorithmic manipulation. In our hyperconnected era, many have begun to wonder whether it is still possible to live a private life, or whether it is no longer worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Right to Oblivion&lt;/i&gt;¬†argues incisively and persuasively that we still can and should strive for privacy, though for different reasons than we might think. Recent years have seen heated debate in the realm of law and technology about why privacy matters, often focusing on how personal data breaches amount to violations of individual freedom. Yet as Lowry Pressly shows, the very terms of this debate have undermined our understanding of privacy‚Äôs real value. In a novel philosophical account, Pressly insists that privacy isn‚Äôt simply a right to be protected but a tool for making life meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy deepens our relationships with others as well as ourselves, reinforcing our capacities for agency, trust, play, self-discovery, and growth. Without privacy, the world would grow shallow, lonely, and inhospitable. Drawing inspiration from the likes of Hannah Arendt, Jorge Luis Borges, and a range of contemporary artists, Pressly shows why we all need a refuge from the world: not a place to hide, but a psychic space beyond the confines of a digital world in which the individual is treated as mere data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lowry Pressly&lt;/b&gt; is a lecturer in the Department of Political Science, the McCoy Family Center for Ethics in Society, and the Stanford Civics Initiative. His philosophical work, criticism, fiction, and translations appear in a wide variety of publications, both academic and popular, including most recently¬†&lt;i&gt;Ethics&lt;/i&gt;,¬†&lt;i&gt;Asymptote&lt;/i&gt;, and the¬†&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alexander¬†Nemerov&lt;/b&gt;¬†is the author of many books on American art, most recently¬†&lt;i&gt;The Forest: A Fable of America in the 1830s&lt;/i&gt;, praised by the novelist Annie Proulx as ‚Äúone of the richest books ever to come my way‚Äîdeeply beautiful, achingly painful and astonishingly tender‚Äù; and¬†&lt;i&gt;Fierce Poise: Helen Frankenthaler and 1950s New York&lt;/i&gt;, named by¬†&lt;i&gt;Vogue&lt;/i&gt;¬†one of its best books of 2021 and a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Biography.¬†Nemerov¬†is the Carl and Marilynn Thoma Provostial Professor in the Arts and Humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Americans can learn geography and be saved; they can forsake it and forever be lost."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;¬†&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;‚ÄîRichard Edes Harrison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Global view maps show the Earth‚Äôs curved surface as if seen from space. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Spheres of Influence, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;an exhibition curated by California Map Society Student Exhibition Contest winner Champ Turner, traces the evolving uses of this unique type of map.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;The global view map emerged in the 1930s and rose to prominence during the turbulent events of the mid-20th century. Widely published in magazines and newspapers, these maps use persuasive visual language to interpret complex international conflicts for the general public. Their emergence coincided with the rise of long-distance air travel and a changing perception of global security. Introduced to a mass audience by cartographer Richard Edes Harrison and rapidly adopted by his contemporaries, the global view countered the prevailing sense of American isolation and challenged audiences to reconsider the relative proximity of international allies and adversaries.¬† &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Using the global view map has allowed cartographers to wield significant influence over the narrative of global conflicts throughout the twentieth century.¬† In this exhibition, we invite you to examine how cartographers, publications, and governments used the global view to inform, persuade and subtly shape our sense of place in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Exhibit Opening: Why Estonia? The 30-year Journey from the USSR to e-Estonia at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with former Estonian Government CIO &lt;b&gt;Luukas Ilves&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Andrew Grotto &lt;/b&gt;(CISAC) to celebrate the opening of the temporary exhibit in Green Library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;"Why Estonia? The 30-Year Journey from the USSR to e-Estonia"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a population of fewer than 1.5 million, Estonia has emerged as a global leader in e-governance. From ID cards and digital voting to online tax declarations and thriving tech startups, Estonia‚Äôs remarkable digital evolution is a testament to visionary decisions and strategic leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transformation wasn‚Äôt inevitable. After regaining independence in the early 1990s, Estonia faced the challenges of rebuilding after 50 years of Soviet occupation. The exhibit, a collaboration between the &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu Museum of Occupations and Freedom&lt;/a&gt; and Stanford Libraries, explores Estonia‚Äôs journey from its historical roots to its digital success, highlighting achievements and challenges along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibit opening features a talk, &lt;b&gt;‚ÄúWhat the world‚Äôs most digital country can teach us about government efficiency and effectiveness?‚Äù&lt;/b&gt; by former Estonian Government CIO &lt;b&gt;Luukas Ilves&lt;/b&gt;, kicking off &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/why-estonia-exhibit"&gt;a series of three talks&lt;/a&gt; on e-Estonia hosted by Stanford Libraries in April-May.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luukas Ilves &lt;/b&gt;is an advisor to the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine on questions of AI and digital transformation and a non-resident fellow at the International Center for Defence Studies (Tallinn, Estonia).¬†&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From 2022‚Äì2024, Luukas was Government CIO and Undersecretary for Digital Transformation of Estonia. He previously held various roles with the Government of Estonia and the European Commission, has worked for the cryptography deep tech Guardtime, and as deputy director and senior fellow at the Lisbon Council (a Brussels-based thinktank).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Luukas is a recipient of the Estonian Order of the White Star and President Zelensky‚Äôs Ukraine Peace Prize. He is a graduate of Stanford University.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening remarks will be delivered by &lt;b&gt;Michael Keller&lt;/b&gt; (Stanford Libraries) and &lt;b&gt;Ivo Lille &lt;/b&gt;(Vabamu), with &lt;b&gt;Andrew Grotto&lt;/b&gt; (CISAC) moderating the discussion.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guided tour of the exhibit will follow the event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Persuasive Data Graphics Practicum with RJ Andrews at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data graphics are magical. Come learn how pictures can help us discover and discuss otherwise invisible phenomena. We will dissect the elements that make charts spectacular, ranging from choosing effective visual metaphors to picturing uncertainty and the subtle art of color-encoding. Our emphasis will be on the hard human decisions necessary to create effective data graphics. Our learning will be anchored by masterpieces of information design,¬†including the study of rare works on display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKbOHdW-so9qbcQvDkTy2s1QnXgom9jH-RKHozcfNj5AAddg/viewform?usp=dialog"&gt;submit a brief application&lt;/a&gt; to apply to take part in the practicum. Applications are due at 5pm PST on &lt;b&gt;Monday, March 24&lt;/b&gt;¬†to be considered. Please note that &lt;u&gt;the practicum is only open to Stanford affiliates.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About RJ Andrews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RJ Andrews is a San Francisco data storyteller. By day, he tackles high-stakes problems for clients like The White House and Google. By night, he studies the history of charts, maps, and diagrams. The overlap between Andrews‚Äô hands-on real-world practice and deep historical research gave rise to his latest book,¬†&lt;i&gt;Info We Trust&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Special, Unique, and Rare: Food at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;Growing, providing, preparing, sharing, and consuming food are all essential for human life.¬†¬†At the most fundamental, biological level, food sustains life by delivering nutrients and staving off hunger. But the ways people eat and the ways they think about food, as well as what people eat -- and don‚Äôt eat -- are strongly influenced by culture, ritual, ethics, climate, geography, technology, and economics.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;Drop by¬†Hohbach 123 (Silicon Valley Archive classroom, Green Library) any time between 2-4 PM on Tuesday, April 8th to partake in a curated tasting menu of Special, Unique and Rare delicacies from the Libraries‚Äô collections that have something to say about FOOD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Information Revolution: How Estonian Cyberneticians Invented the Information Age in the Soviet Empire at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for a talk by &lt;b&gt;Aro Velmet¬†&lt;/b&gt;(University of Southern California)¬†on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Information Revolution: How Estonian Cyberneticians Invented the Information Age in the Soviet Empire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia is often portrayed as the world‚Äôs most advanced ‚Äûdigital state, ‚Äú where citizens can vote, do their taxes, and renew their driver‚Äôs license, all online. But before the ‚Äûdigital state,‚Äú there was the ‚ÄûNational Automated Control System." From the 1960s, cyberneticians, sociologists, and management scientists in Ukraine, Estonia, Novosibirsk, and elsewhere imagined constructing a network of data centers ‚Äì the NACS ‚Äì that would revitalize the Soviet empire. They failed in building this network, but their expertise catalyzed large social movements that ultimately contributed to the empire‚Äôs collapse.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk provides a history of the information age in the Soviet Union. This history is relevant not only because expertise from this period led to some of the most innovative work in digital public infrastructure in 1990s Estonia but also because visionaries then were grappling with questions that remain relevant today: What is the relationship between digital technology and the state? What are the risks and rewards of collecting and processing data about the public? And can technology aid or disrupt the functioning of an authoritarian state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aro Velmet&lt;/b&gt; is an Associate Professor of History at the University of Southern California. He is a visiting researcher at the Davis Center at Princeton University and a visiting researcher at the Institute of Social Studies at the University of Tartu. He writes about technological utopias and the history of science in a variety of imperial and post-imperial contexts. His first book, Pasteur‚Äôs Empire (Oxford University Press, 2020), looked at how bacteriologists reimagined imperial governance in early twentieth century France. His current project, The Information Revolution, looks at how computer engineers reimagined imperial governance in late twentieth century Soviet Union.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will be followed by a Q&amp;amp;A session and screening of the film, &lt;b&gt;"Disco and Atomic War" &lt;/b&gt;(2009).¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The film tells the story of a strange kind of information war, where a totalitarian regime stands face to face with the heroes of popular culture. And loses. It was a time when it was possible for erotic film star Emmanuelle to bring down the Red Army and MacGyver to outdo an entire school administration. It is a film about our generation, who were unknowingly brought to the front line of the Cold War. Western popular culture had an incomparable role shaping Soviet children's world views in those days. Finnish television was a window to a world of dreams that the authorities could not block in any way. Though Finnish channels were banned, many households found some way to access the forbidden fruit." ‚Äì Warsaw Film Festival&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/XqSgxs4Y1R5UGfsj9"&gt;Registration is requested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From April to May, Stanford Libraries hosts three public talks that are related to the &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/why-estonia-exhibit"&gt;"Why Estonia?" exhibit in Green Library &lt;/a&gt;and that explore e-Estonia‚Äôs history, achievements, challenges, and the potential applicability of its e-governance model in the U.S.:¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/exhibit-opening-why-estonia"&gt;April 2, 2025: Exhibit Opening Featuring a Talk by Luukas Ilves, ‚ÄúWhat the world‚Äôs most digital country can teach us about government efficiency and effectiveness?‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mapping Time, Space and Habitat: a talk by Dr. Ben Gitai at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humans have always shaped and been shaped by the landscapes they inhabit. "Chronomapping" is an innovative methodology developed by Dr. Gitai that investigates landscape transformations through time by integrating data and insights from disciplines such as architecture, landscape architecture, hydrology, urban planning, climatology, ecology, sociology, anthropology, political geography, history, and even the psychology of aesthetics. The methodology is a means to produce visual representations and new conceptual frameworks of territories and habitats across time. It can also cast power dynamics and territorial transformations in new lights by examining the interplay between terrain, territory, and cartography across historical periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model is designed to serve as a counterbalance to the short-sightedness that has characterized much development in the Western world. The methodology is explicitly designed to account for the palimpsestic nature of development. It has both scholarly and practical applications with potential utility in fields of governance, urban and spatial planning, and¬†industrial development. Dr. Gitai's lecture will reference two of his forthcoming publications:¬†&lt;i&gt;Mapping Power: History of Landscape in the Jordan Valley&lt;/i&gt;¬†and¬†&lt;i&gt;Landscapes Atlas of Paris&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the speaker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ben Gitai integrates geography, architecture, and related disciplines in his research and practice. He has taught at various institutions in Switzerland (ETHZ, EPFL) and France. His cross-disciplinary approach combines tools and perspectives from landscape architecture, urban planning, political geography, and history, exploring the evolution of geo-spatial configurations over historical periods and how these transformations reflect broader socio-political and economic processes. His work recontextualizes mapping practices as instruments for understanding the complex relationships between human and natural systems, offering innovative perspectives on the forces that shape our environments. Today, he is the head coordinator of the Habitat Research Center and the Paris Atlas of Landscapes at EPFL.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Jacob Anbinder, "NIMBY Nation: The War on Growth That Created Our Housing Crisis and Remade American Politics" at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming Jacob Anbinder on May 29, 2025, as he discusses his upcoming book.¬†&lt;i&gt;NIMBY Nation: The War on Growth That Created Our Housing Crisis and Remade American Politics.¬†&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NIMBY Nation&lt;/i&gt; is the first history of the modern urban affordability crisis and the political origins of the liberal ‚ÄúNIMBY.‚Äù It traces their roots to the national party realignment of the late twentieth century and, specifically, to the ideological transformations that took place among liberals around the issue of urban growth. During the New Deal Era, Democrats across the country emphatically supported the growth of cities and suburbs. Beginning in the fifties, however, Americans dismayed by the unfulfilled promises of postwar society began to question the idea that ‚Äúthe good life‚Äù demanded the continued development of the places in which they lived. Over the decades that followed, a constellation of loosely related citizen efforts to guide, limit, or reverse the course of metropolitan growth coalesced into a powerful movement uniting voters, activists, intellectuals, and politicians who once had little in common. By the late twentieth century, their work had produced a new¬†antigrowth liberalism¬†that appealed to disillusioned New Dealers, lapsed leftists, and moderates abandoning the Republican Party. This new generation of Democrats was much more skeptical of‚Äîand in many cases downright hostile toward‚Äînot only urban growth itself, but also the idea that such growth was in any way compatible with liberalism as they now defined it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing how debates about urban growth were central to the process by which the fragile social order of the twentieth century gave way to the fractious politics of the twenty-first,¬†&lt;i&gt;NIMBY Nation&lt;/i&gt;¬†offers a new understanding of the thing that we call ‚Äúliberalism,‚Äù the influence of local politics in its creation, and its role in making modern American society. While many on the left believe today that America‚Äôs most pressing problems‚Äîparticularly in its largest cities‚Äîoriginate in the Democratic Party‚Äôs supposed rightward turn, the history of antigrowth politics shows that Democrats never abandoned their core principle of using government power to effect social progress. Rather, in ‚Äúblue‚Äù cities across the country, new groups of liberals reworked New Deal liberalism to serve different goals, on different ideological bases, at different levels of governance. Their success at reining in the ‚Äúgrowth machine‚Äù benefited a fortunate few. Yet, their worldview‚Äôs own contradictions‚Äîunresolved and perhaps unresolvable‚Äîalso produced the permanent housing shortages, exorbitant real estate prices, unsustainable commutes, and intensified segregation that plague cities today. Moving away from the popular idea that America followed a linear path from ‚Äúbig government‚Äù to ‚Äúneoliberalism,‚Äù¬†NIMBY Nation¬†demonstrates that our current cost-of-living crisis is the result not of the inexorable power of laissez-faire‚Äîor of simplistic liberal hypocrisy‚Äîbut rather of Democrats‚Äô deliberate attempts to improve the cities and suburbs in which they lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jacob Anbinder&lt;/b&gt; is a historian of the modern United States with a particular focus on the politics of cities and suburbs in the twentieth century. His research interests include the political economy of major infrastructure projects, movements for and against change to the built environment, and the ways in which sprawl and spatial segregation create social inequities. His writing has been published in¬†&lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;¬†The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;¬†U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;¬†Business History Review&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;¬†The Week&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;¬†Democracy: A Journal of Ideas&lt;/i&gt;, and other outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
