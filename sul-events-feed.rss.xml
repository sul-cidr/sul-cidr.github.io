      <title>Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the essence, and the form fades away at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;청계 차일수: 득의망상 (得意忘象)&lt;br&gt;
Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the Essence, and the Form Fades Away&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stanford East Asia Library presents an exhibition by the South Korean artist Cheonggea Ilsu Cha from November 18, 2024 to February 20, 2025. Artist Cha has dedicated his 40-year career to the mastery of ‘literati’ painting.  The literati genre combines written word with a painterly interpretation of text, a form of art that has been practiced by the scholarly elite in Korea for over 400 years. His work has been featured at the prestigious Grand Art Exhibition of Korea, and he has held eight solo exhibitions.&lt;br&gt;
A significant number of Korean scholars practiced literati painting during the Joseon Dynasty, which extended from 1392 to 1897. Literati painting reflects the scholar’s observation, understanding and interpretation of a poetic topic. The artist strives for aesthetic discipline; the text must be no longer than what the topic minimally requires. So too must the artist seek simplicity in his visual vocabulary.  The exhibition is inspired by the philosophy of Tŭgŭi mangsang (得意忘象), which emphasizes abandoning artifice in order to seek the true nature of things.  The works at the exhibition employ the use of ink and a constrained palette of color using materials such as traditional Korean paper, scrolls, and fans. The paintings touch on a wide variety of topics, from nature to philosophical reflections to expressions of human emotion. Cha’s work is inspired by the artistic sensibility of his predecessors. Visitors to the museum will find paintings imbued with a classic aesthetic, timeless charm, and a lively wit.&lt;br&gt;
This exhibition of Cha’s Korean literati paintings was curated by Jee-Young Park, Korean Studies Librarian at Stanford East Asia Library; Ji Soo Kim, M.A. in  Museum Studies from San Francisco State University; and Wooju Chong, M. A. in Center for East Asian Studies from Stanford University, in consultation with the East Asia Library Exhibits Committee.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Love Data Week 2025 BioBlitz</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/"&gt;Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2025 Love Data Week BioBlitz begins with the Generating and Using Biodiversity Big Data virtual workshop where participants will learn about locating, downloading, and cleaning biodiversity data for research. Following the workshop, participants will be invited to join an asynchronous &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/stanford-love-data-week-2025-bioblitz"&gt;Bioblitz&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/"&gt;iNaturalist platform&lt;/a&gt; to generate biodiversity data that will be shared with the open data repository GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). Participants will learn how to search for data of interest, learn about some of the caveats of using biodiversity big data, how to clean and properly attribute data, and will also contribute data themselves by participating in a week-long Bioblitz across Stanford campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting/register/vKuOzqPKQlqBNn2CwE_pqg"&gt;Register for the virtual workshop&lt;/a&gt;, taking place on Monday, February 10, 1-2:30PM PT.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: Authenticity by Design at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet is at an inflection point. With the growth of artificial intelligence and synthetic media, trust in information faces unprecedented threats. Authenticity is not guaranteed. At the same time, new technologies–referred to as “Web 3”–present opportunities to protect the integrity of data. These solutions can be applied to critical practices including investigative journalism, historical archiving, and the admissibility of legal evidence. This exhibit, curated by the &lt;a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/"&gt;Starling Lab for Data Integrity&lt;/a&gt;, asks: How might we design information systems for authenticity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/visitor-access" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>California Pop-up Exhibit @ Branner Earth Sciences Library at Mitchell Earth Sciences</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Stanford Libraries pop-up exhibits on &lt;b&gt;California&lt;/b&gt;, Branner Earth Sciences Library &amp;amp; Map Collections will be featuring maps, reports, and minerals created as part of the&lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/sgs-collection"&gt; &lt;b&gt;Stanford Geological Survey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, February 13, 2025 from 1-3pm in Branner Library (2nd Floor, Mitchell Earth Sciences Building). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On display will be several items including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/7594435"&gt;Herbert Hoover's student topographic map of the Stanford campus created c. 1893.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5968665"&gt;Report and map by Mary Balch Kennedy (1929)&lt;/a&gt; who was not allowed to attend the required Summer Geology Camp because she was a woman, instead she had to map the geology of the New Almaden Quadrangle alone in rugged terrain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/4793992"&gt;R.B. Marshall's map (1895) covering a large amount, if not all, of the Stanford lands&lt;/a&gt;.  He notes the "marsh line" which extended to present day HIghway 101 as a dotted line across the top section of the map. This may be the only map from this time depicting the marshlands with such detail at this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will also feature several minerals from the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability Specimen Collection, collected during the surveys or in surveyed areas, including Epidote, Gold, Jade, Actinolite, and Quartz&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Epicenters: Navigating Recovery and Renewal from Disasters at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;In the wake of disaster, maps play many roles, shaping understanding of the event in the immediate aftermath, serving as visceral portrayals for those who were not there, and communicating both scale and extent of the tragedy. They gavanize support for rebuilding by showing new possible futures and can be used to memorialize the event, inscribing the memory over the landscape. Drawing upon sources from historical representations to contemporary satellite imagery, the maps in this exhibition explore various ways communities use maps to make sense of calamity and move forward from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;The exhibition was curated by Stanford student Muhammad Dhafer, winner of the 2024 California Map Society student exhibition competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This exhibition is ongoing and will be available until Friday, March 7th, 2025. To view the exhibit, visit the David Rumsey Map Center during its public drop-in hours.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using LLMs to Extract Structured Data from PDFs at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger" style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This workshop is part of Stanford's &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;Love Data Week 2025&lt;/a&gt;. The topic is the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract structured data from PDFs or other data. Imagine that you have a PDF with some tabular data in it, like a table. You want that data to work in a computable form (like CSV) for use in Excel or other tools.

      <title>Inaugural Stanford Data Artists Meet Up at GSE Makery, Stanford Graduate School of Education</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have data or make art (or both!) and want to connect with people exploring novel artistic ways of representing data? Stanford Data Artists is a brand-new community of students, faculty, and staff transforming data into art forms, whether musical compositions, theater props, sculptures, living paintings, woodworking, creative writing, textiles—the works! Our first event is a casual opportunity to meet other cross-disciplinary, curious, creative, cool creators, to peruse samples of data art, and to eat some tasty snacks. Bring your own data (BYOD) and chat with us about how it could be art-ified! Ideas/questions/pipe dreams in all flavors of quirky and imaginative are welcome here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday, February 13, 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 PM - 4:30 PM PT, &lt;a href="https://gse-makery.stanford.edu/"&gt;GSE Makery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabletop Tuesdays: Studying Data with the game Rescue Polar Bears: Data &amp; Temperature at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month's Tabletop Tuesdays is part of &lt;a href="https://lovedataweek.stanford.edu/" style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;a series for Love Data Week&lt;/a&gt;, an annual festival highlighting topics, opportunities and services relevant to data in research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rescue Polar Bears: Data &amp;amp; Temperature is a cooperative game based on Rescue Polar Bears with a new data and temperature system added to the game design to make the strategy more diversified. The consumption of fossil fuel and releasing of greenhouse gases yield the global warming. Around the North Pole, the last icebergs are melting and the polar bears are facing the risk of being extinct. The players form a scientific organization. They try to collect data about climate change to persuade the governments to change their energy policy. At the same time, they also need to prevent polar bears from sinking into the freezing water. Each player drives a rescue ship of different ability to complete the mission on the Arctic Ocean. As long as the players collectively gather enough data, they win together. However, if too many polar bears sink into the water, everyone loses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tabletop Tuesdays is an event series held on the third Tuesday of each month. At these events, we feature a selection of board games and collection items from across SUL's holdings around a specific theme. Drop in to learn about the month's featured game(s) and/or try some of the board games we have for open play at the Silicon Valley Archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ART/WORK at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/special-collections-exhibits"&gt;ART/WORK | Creative Pursuits of Stanford Libraries Staff&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; on view February 20, 2024, through April 27, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this exhibition, we sought to create a space where staff could share their artistic, creative side that may not otherwise be a part of their work at Stanford. In the Summer of 2024, Special Collections invited current Stanford Libraries staff to enter creative work in any medium to be considered for a Winter 2025 exhibit in Green Library’s Peterson Gallery and Rotunda. Response to the call for entries was hearty. In addition to traditional fine art techniques of drawing, painting, printmaking, and photography, submissions included mixed media sculpture, ceramics, collage, textiles, and poetry. An anonymous selection committee of library staff blind-reviewed over a hundred entries and chose the fifty works displayed in the galleries. We asked the people whose pieces were selected to write a brief statement to accompany their work in the exhibit and posed several questions for their consideration: Why do creative work? What medium do you work in and why? How did you get started? What does it mean to you to be an artist (if you define yourself as one)? Does art need an audience? Who is your audience? What influences your work, and whose work do you admire? As you will see, Stanford library staff are talented and thoughtful, pursuing many forms of creative work after hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Roberto Trujillo, Associate University Librarian, Director of Special Collections and Frances and Charles Field Curator of Special Collections; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions, with assistance from Elizabeth Fischbach.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their careful consideration of all staff art submissions, we thank the staff members who served on the jury; For their assessment of materials, Aisha Wahab and Beth Ryan in Conservation Services; For their assistance with logistics Ranelle Sharma and Jacob Cohn in Library Facilities, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Library Hours page &lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Science for Preterm Birth Research: Advancing Discovery Through a Public Data Repository and a DREAM Crowdsourcing Challenge (Bay Area Open Science Group)</title>
      <description>&lt;p style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This month, the Bay Area Open Science Group will be joined by Tomiko Oskotsky, a physician-scientist in the Sirota Lab at the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, UCSF. She earned her B.S. in Biochemistry from UCLA and her M.D. from the Medical College of Wisconsin, where she was elected to the Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) National Medical Honor Society. Her research involves interrogating diverse datasets, including electronic health records, to better understand human health and disease. Her leadership roles include co-leading the March of Dimes preterm birth research data repository and directing the UCSF AI4ALL program, which teaches AI to underrepresented youth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Targeting students, faculty, and staff at UCSF, Berkeley, and Stanford, the goal of the community is to increase awareness of and engagement with all things open science, including open access articles, open research data, open source software, and open educational resources. Through this work the group hopes to connect researchers with tools they can use to make the products and process of science more equitable and reproducible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Information Revolution:  How Soviet Cyberneticists Built the Liberal Information Age at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for a talk by &lt;b&gt;Aro Velmet &lt;/b&gt;(University of Southern California) on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Information Revolution:  How Soviet Cyberneticists Built the Liberal Information Age&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia is often portrayed as the world’s most advanced „digital state,“ where citizens can vote, do their taxes, and renew their driver’s license, all online. According to this story, after fifty years of Soviet occupation, Estonia understood the dangers of monopolizing information and chose to break with the Soviet legacy by building a state where information was transparent, available, and online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk offers a different perspective. It explores the role of Soviet cybernetics and late socialist reform movements in the construction of the first iterations of the digital state. Why did Soviet thinkers imagine information technology as the solution to political and economic stagnation? And what can the long history of the information processing state tell us about late modern politics?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aro Velmet&lt;/b&gt; is an associate professor of history at the University of Southern California. He is a visiting researcher at the Davis Center at Princeton University and a visiting researcher at the Institute of Social Studies at the University of Tartu. He writes about technological utopias and the history of science in a variety of imperial and post-imperial contexts. His first book, Pasteur’s Empire (Oxford University Press, 2020), looked at how bacteriologists reimagined imperial governance in early twentieth century France. His current project, The Information Revolution, looks at how computer engineers reimagined imperial governance in late twentieth century Soviet Union.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will be followed by a Q&amp;amp;A session and screening of the film, &lt;b&gt;"Disco and Atomic War" &lt;/b&gt;(2009). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The film tells the story of a strange kind of information war, where a totalitarian regime stands face to face with the heroes of popular culture. And loses. It was a time when it was possible for erotic film star Emmanuelle to bring down the Red Army and MacGyver to outdo an entire school administration. It is a film about our generation, who were unknowingly brought to the front line of the Cold War. Western popular culture had an incomparable role shaping Soviet children's world views in those days. Finnish television was a window to a world of dreams that the authorities could not block in any way. Though Finnish channels were banned, many households found some way to access the forbidden fruit." – Warsaw Film Festival&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/Q73EoNMCSZB28UrH9"&gt;Registration is requested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rebooting a Nation: The Incredible Rise of Estonia, E-Government and the Startup Revolution at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with Author &lt;b&gt;Joel Burke &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Andrew Grotto &lt;/b&gt;(CISAC) on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rebooting a Nation: The Incredible Rise of Estonia, E-Government and the Startup Revolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three decades after gaining independence from the Soviet Union, Estonia is a nation transformed. Today, the country is known around the world as a startup hub, with numerous local billion-dollar companies including Wise, Veriff, and Bolt. More impressive are Estonia’s pioneering efforts in e-government. With 99% of government services digitalized and accessible online, citizens can vote via computer and file their taxes online in minutes, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance and automate government services long predates ChatGPT. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book talk, the author of &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/rebooting-a-nation-9781805263012?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rebooting a Nation: The Incredible Rise of Estonia, E-Government and the Startup Revolution&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Joel Burke offers unique insight into Estonia’s rapid rise as a tech and e-government powerhouse since the turn of the century. From the founding of Skype to the future of the e-state, he unveils the tactics and stories behind Estonia’s spectacular journey—after years of Soviet occupation and mismanagement to global tech leadership. For those hoping to learn from Estonia’s incredible journey, Burke offers insights into the government’s use of AI, its creation of a digital society, and its cultivation of a culture driving public-sector creativity and innovation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joel Burke&lt;/b&gt; is a research fellow at fp21. A former AI Fellow for Senator Mike Rounds, Joel advised the office on AI, technology, and security issues. Previously, he worked in various roles and geographies including in Tallinn as Head of Business Development for e-Residency, the Republic of Estonia’s flagship digital initiative. Other experiences include working as a fellow in Cameroon staffed to a local startup via Venture for Africa; serving as a NYCx Fellow; working as a Partner at Tribe.AI, a managed marketplace for top AI talent; and leading a venture for a Rocket Internet AG subsidiary in Berlin. He started his career at a YC and Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk is moderated by &lt;b&gt;Andrew Grotto&lt;/b&gt;, Research Scholar, Center for International Security and Cooperation (FSI). &lt;br&gt;
