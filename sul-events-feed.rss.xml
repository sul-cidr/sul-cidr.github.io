      <title>Digital Typography: Mathematics, Chinese, and More at Robin Li and Melissa Ma Science Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This exhibit explores digital typography, and its uses and challenges in a variety of settings, including mathematics and non-Western languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featured materials include scholarship on the history and implementation of digital typography. There are texts on LaTeX, a software system for typesetting documents with mathematical notation developed by Donald Knuth, a famous computer scientist who you can sometimes see riding around Stanford on his bicycle. There is also a book on the history of digital input systems for the Chinese language written by Stanford professor Thomas Mullaney. Additionally, there are flyers from Stanford Initiative on Language Inclusion and Conservation in Old and New Media (SILICON), codirected by Prof. Mullaney, showcasing SILICON's work developing typefaces for digitally disadvantaged languages. The juxtaposition of these different lenses through which to view digital typography makes for an interesting and wholistic view of the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit dovetails with other happenings at the Stanford Libraries. In particular, there will be workshops on LaTeX in the Li &amp;amp; Ma Science library in late October, one covering &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/latex-fundamentals-workshop"&gt;the fundamentals&lt;/a&gt; and another covering &lt;a href="https://events.stanford.edu/event/biblatex-and-zotero-workshop"&gt;bibliographies and integration with reference management software&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the East Asia Library has recently acquired the only prototype of the &lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/mingkwai"&gt;MingKwai Chinese typewriter&lt;/a&gt;, which prefigured modern digital Chinese input methods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Essential Engagement: The Works of Joseph DeLappe at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;"The theoretical basis for my work lies in the belief that it is essential, as an artist and citizen of the world, to engage in and challenge the norms and expectations of the digital present and the larger cultural context." &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- Joseph DeLappe, artist statement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;The prolific work of Joseph DeLappe, spanning a wide range of physical and digital mediums, provides an opportunity for critical reflection and thoughtful discussions about our relationship to technology and the post-9/11 political landscape. As the most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history and development of the Silicon Valley region, the Silicon Valley Archives is honored to exhibit a selection of this work and bring the history of recent technology into conversation with our present through this pioneering artist’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/about-stanford-libraries/visit-us"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on the Libraries’ website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joseph DeLappe&lt;/b&gt;, born San Francisco 1963, is an artist, activist and educator, he relocated to Scotland from the USA in 2017 where he is the Professor of Games and Tactical Media at Abertay University, Dundee. Working with electronic and digital media since 1983, projects in online gaming performance, sculpture and electromechanical installation have been shown throughout the world. He has developed works for venues such as Eyebeam Art and Technology in New York, The Guangdong Museum of Art, China, the Southern Utah Museum of Art and Transitio MX, Mexico City, among many others. Creative works and actions have been featured widely in scholarly journals, books and in the popular media, including the &lt;i&gt;New York Times, The Australian Morning Herald, Art in America, The Guardian &lt;/i&gt;and the BBC. &lt;a href="https://www.delappe.net/"&gt;More information about DeLappe and his artwork is available on his website. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Colonial Gulf: How Empires Documented a Region at Mitchell Earth Sciences</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;How have colonial and imperial regimes imagined and represented the Persian Gulf? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This exhibit explores how the British, Ottoman and American empires documented the human and non-human geography, resources, and landscapes of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It features historical maps and artifacts from the collections of the Branner Earth Sciences Library and the David Rumsey Map Center alongside cartographic visualizations created by the &lt;a href="https://opengulf.github.io/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;OpenGulf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; research collective.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Featured materials include maps derived from a dataset collected from the &lt;i&gt;British Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Arabia, and Oman&lt;/i&gt; created using QGIS, including the map of mentions of date palms displayed here.  By placing these historical materials and contemporary analyses in conversation, we uncover a genealogy of geographical thinking alongside the power structures embedded in imperial and colonial record-keeping.  This exhibit aims to illustrate and critically engage the breadth, depth, and nature of colonial and imperial knowledge production regarding the Persian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula, highlighting its varied expressions in texts, maps, and charts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This exhibition is also available to &lt;a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/b90cd597a47f46d39567b4c9824ca6ee"&gt;&lt;span&gt;view digitally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sponsored by: &lt;a href="https://history.stanford.edu" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dept. of History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://cesta.stanford.edu" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CESTA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stanford Libraries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11.0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Books and a selection of maps are displayed on the library's main floor. Additional maps are displayed on the library mezzanine exhibit wall (access from within the library). The exhibit is available for viewing during &lt;a href="https://library-hours.stanford.edu/libraries/branner"&gt;&lt;span&gt;regular library open hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;

      <title>To the World: China’s Multimedia Campaign during the Cold War at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The call “People of the World, Unite!” was a story China once told itself. When the world was polarized, the vision of global solidarity paradoxically prevailed in the People’s Republic of China during its Cold War isolation, manifested in a myriad of media categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To the World” unveils the diverse and far-reaching multimedia campaign in China. Drawing from the special collection at the East Asia library, this exhibition highlights how the regime propagated its international vision inward to the domestic audience from the 1950s to the 1970, and the interplay of ideas and ideologies shaping China’s self-presentation and portrayal of other countries and ethnicities in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibition also contributes to a vibrant and expanding field of scholarship that has significantly advanced our understanding of China’s media in recent history. Scholars such as Andrew Jones, Christine Ho, and Jie Li have explored the complexities of culture and history by integrating media and trans media, encompassing text, photography, film, visual art, music, and radio. The objects on display—multilingual editions of the Little Red Book, vinyl records, English textbooks, cartoon illustrations, and so on—serve as primary sources for understanding media and mediation in the everyday realities of the bygone era. Thus, the exhibition invites students, scholars, and the broader public to reconsider the complexities of China’s media landscape and encourages newlines of inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhibition on view from September 22 to December 20, 2025&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To the World” is curated by Yue Wu (PhD student, East Asian Languages and Cultures) and Zhaohui Xue (Curator for the Chinese Collection), with consultation from Professor Ban Wang (William Haas Professor in Chinese Studies). The exhibition is generously sponsored by the Stanford East Asia Library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Amos Gitai Archive at Stanford at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;a href="http://library.stanford.edu/special-collections-exhibits"&gt;The Amos Gitai Archive at Stanford&lt;/a&gt;, on view in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda from November 17, 2025, to February 15, 2026. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Amos Gitai’s strategy for his artistic legacy might be likened to the principle of "scatter in order to endure.” The way he has distributed traces of his films is a means of bringing to life, internationally, the memory of his filmography, the history of his young country, and universal themes about the fragility and degradation of memory. In this era of digital archives, Gitai decided early on to place his work at well-known international institutions, among them Stanford and the National Library of France. The Gitai archive at Stanford is characterized by its historical depth, featuring eight films spanning the years 1980 to 2014, as well as multimedia works from the 2020s. It contains 10.5 terabytes of photographs, screenplays, scripts, letters, and shooting reports. Also included are rushes, early cuts, subtitles, scores, and post-production documents revealing traces of the artistic process. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;i&gt;House&lt;/i&gt; trilogy (1980, 1998, 2005) revolves around a house in West Jerusalem—its successive inhabitants, their descendants, and the people who worked on it. It brings the memory this house bears to the eyes and ears of old and new generations, those who have stayed and those who have scattered, from the new arrivals from Turkey to the descendants of the Palestinian family now settled in Jordan, zooming out from a close-up of the house to encompass the entire geopolitical fate of the region. Whereas the House trilogy has historical depth and spans several generations, the &lt;i&gt;Borders&lt;/i&gt; trilogy—comprising &lt;i&gt;Promised Land&lt;/i&gt; (2004), &lt;i&gt;Free Zone&lt;/i&gt; (2005), and &lt;i&gt;Disengagement&lt;/i&gt; (2007)—was created over a shorter timeframe. These two trilogies, one documentary and one fiction, enter into a type of resonance. &lt;i&gt;News from Home / News from House&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Free Zone&lt;/i&gt; were shot simultaneously in 2004 and share images, cover the same geography and history, and both deal with porous memory and its gradual disintegration. The Gitai archive at Stanford also contains the archives of the films &lt;i&gt;Plus Tard Tu Comprendes&lt;/i&gt; (One Day You’ll Understand) (2008) and &lt;i&gt;Tsili&lt;/i&gt; (2014). Both are adaptations of literary works by contemporary authors. Both raise questions about the transmission of Holocaust memory in a European context, as well as cinematographic and ethical questions about how to film the words of others. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Gitai’s work on the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, part of his archives at the National Library of France, showcased in a forthcoming book published by Stanford University Libraries, could be described as a series of palimpsests, an endless process of revision and editing to understand precisely what happened and what was lost with Rabin’s assassination. And it is also an aesthetic journey, like &lt;i&gt;House&lt;/i&gt;, a decades-long exploration of broad histories told through focus on a single figure. With this exhibition, we invite you to explore Gitai’s archive at Stanford and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibition is curated by Ayda Melika and Eitan Kensky with texts by Marie-José Sanselme and Marie-Pierre Ulloa; produced by Deardra Fuzzell, with assistance from Elizabeth Fischbach and Pasha Tope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lavinia's Wondrous Portraits: The Making of a Children's Book at McMurtry Building</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This exhibition showcases &lt;i&gt;Lavinia's Wondrous Portraits&lt;/i&gt;, a children’s book by Stanford art historian Emanuele Lugli that explores why portraits matter through the life and work of Lavinia Fontana, Europe’s first professional woman painter. Illustrated by Chiara Palillo, the book is more than a study of portraiture and early modern women—it is an artist’s book in itself, a hybrid creation where collage, acrylic, cyanotype, and digital color converge in playful, unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening reception, Oct. 16, 4-6 pm in the lobby outside the library.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Above &amp; Below: Cartography Beyond Terrain at David Rumsey Map Center (Green Library) </title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Above &amp;amp; Below: Cartography Beyond Terrain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt; is an exhibition that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt; explores how cartography depicts the depths of the Earth, the ocean floor, weather systems, the solar system, and even the seemingly intangible internet – anything but the thin boundary that divides land and sky that we tend to associate with maps. The exhibition celebrates the multifaceted nature of mapping, inviting reflection on our interconnected existence and revealing the beauty and complexity of our world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MingKwai, Rediscovered at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us on December 2, 2025, as we explore the origins of of the incredible MingKwai typewriter, trace its history across continents, and examine its lasting cultural and technological impact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MingKwai Chinese Typewriter, a milestone in the history of Chinese information technology, was invented by the Chinese-born author, translator, and cultural commentator Lin Yutang in the 1940s. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/nyregion/mingkwai-typewriter-china.html"&gt;Discovered in a New York basement&lt;/a&gt;, this extraordinary prototype has been entrusted to the Stanford University Libraries, where it will be used in research, exhibits, and academic programs. Read more about this discovery in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/05/mingkwai-chinese-typewriter-prototype-stanford-libraries"&gt;The Stanford Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/05/nx-s1-5405452/chinese-typewriter-mingkwai-stanford"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the typewriter’s rediscovery and new home at Stanford, we will be bringing together scholars and experts from across multiple disciplines to reintroduce the legendary MingKwai Chinese Typewriter to the world. Dr. Thomas S. Mullaney, Professor of Chinese History at Stanford University, will lead a team of researchers and students in exploring the MingKwai&lt;i&gt;'&lt;/i&gt;s historical, technological, and cultural significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/mingkwai"&gt;Learn&lt;/a&gt; about the typewriter, and &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mingkwai-rediscovered-tickets-1752379427039"&gt;secure your ticket&lt;/a&gt; to the symposium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Max Kasy in conversation with Rob Reich on How AI Really Works and Who Benefits at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI is inescapable, from its mundane uses online to its increasingly consequential decision-making in courtrooms, job interviews, and wars. The ubiquity of AI is so great that it might produce public resignation—a sense that the technology is our shared fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how is the technical structure of AI shaped by social power and inequalities? In this book talk and conversation, Max Kasy will discuss how who AI serves is determined not by the technology itself but by who it is built to serve. How can we shape AI to benefit all? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Kasy’s new book, &lt;i&gt;The Means of Prediction&lt;/i&gt;, reveals how artificial intelligence, far from being an unstoppable force, is irrevocably shaped by human decisions—choices made to date by the ownership class that steers its development and deployment. The technology of AI, Kasy insists, is ultimately not that complex. It is insidious, however, in its capacity to steer results to its owners’ wants and ends. Kasy clearly and accessibly explains the fundamental principles on which AI works, and, in doing so, reveals that the real conflict isn’t between humans and machines, but between those who control the machines and the rest of us.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Means of Prediction&lt;/i&gt; offers a powerful vision of the future of AI: a future not shaped by technology, but by the technology’s owners. Amid a deluge of debates about technical details, new possibilities, and social problems, Kasy cuts to the core issue: Who controls AI’s objectives, and how is this control maintained? The answer lies in what he calls “the means of prediction,” or the essential resources required for building AI systems: data, computing power, expertise, and energy. As Kasy shows, in a world already defined by inequality, one of humanity’s most consequential technologies has been and will be steered by those already in power.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Against those stakes, Kasy offers an elegant framework both for understanding AI’s capabilities and for designing its public control. He makes a compelling case for democratic control over AI objectives as the answer to mounting concerns about AI’s risks and harms. &lt;i&gt;The Means of Prediction &lt;/i&gt;is a revelation, both an expert undressing of a technology that has masqueraded as more complicated and a compelling call for public oversight of this transformative technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kasy is joined in conversation by Rob Reich, the McGregor-Girand Professor of Social Ethics of Science and Technology at Stanford. Reich’s scholarship in political theory engages with the work of social scientists and engineers. His newest work is on governance of frontier science and technology. His most recent books are &lt;i&gt;System Error: Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Reboot&lt;/i&gt; (with Mehran Sahami and Jeremy M. Weinstein, HarperCollins 2021) and &lt;i&gt;Digital Technology and Democratic Theory&lt;/i&gt; (edited with Lucy Bernholz and Hélène Landemore, University of Chicago Press 2021). Reich has testified before Congress and written widely for the public, including for the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;Stanford Social Innovation Review&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kasy is a professor of economics at Oxford University, where he coordinates the Machine Learning and Economics Group. His research interests include machine learning theory, publication bias, adaptive experimental design, statistical decision theory, identification and causality, and economic inequality. He has received grants from the Alfred P. Sloan foundation, served as an expert for the EU Directorate for Research and Innovation, and received the Young Economist Award from the Economic Association of Austria.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hope and Despair: The Emotional Response to the War in Ukraine at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for an engaging conversation with Gabrielius Landsbergis, Bernard and Susan Liautaud Visiting Fellow, and Michael McFaul, Director of the Freeman Spogli Institute, as they discuss the emotional journey surrounding Russia's war against Ukraine, its global implications, and transatlantic support for Ukraine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hope and Despair: The Emotional Response to the War in Ukraine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every few months, new technological developments or limited battlefield successes by either Russia or Ukraine spark sweeping claims that the war's outcome has been decided. Shortly thereafter, these narratives often collapse, leading to a reversal and a cycle of inflated expectations followed by disillusionment. Despite this tumultuous rollercoaster of hope and despair, one fact remains clear: Ukraine has not lost, and Russia has not won. Both outcomes – and their opposites – are still possible. For those of us who support Ukraine, this uncertainty is, in itself, a positive sign. However, hope alone cannot be our only strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a discussion with Michael McFaul, Gabrielius Landsbergis will explore how to cut through the shifting headlines to understand the real picture and what actions must be taken to strengthen Ukraine, so that hope is not our sole approach. He will examine what fuels this state of uncertainty and what factors can help us grasp the balance of power on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gabrielius Landsbergis &lt;/b&gt;served as minister of foreign affairs of Lithuania from 2020 to 2024, a pivotal period for the region. He led Lithuania’s diplomatic service guided by the principle of values-based foreign policy. During his tenure, Lithuania emerged as one of the most vocal supporters of Ukraine, Taiwan, and freedom fighters worldwide. Before that, he served in the Parliament of Lithuania from 2016, was chairman of the Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives), and was elected to the European Parliament in 2014. Prior to entering politics, Gabrielius Landsbergis was a career diplomat.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He currently serves as Bernard and Susan Liautaud Visiting Fellow at Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael McFaul&lt;/b&gt; is director at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, the Ken Olivier and Angela Nomellini Professor of International Studies in the Department of Political Science, and the Peter and Helen Bing Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1995. He served for five years in the Obama administration, first as special assistant to the President and senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council at the White House (2009-2012), and then as U.S. ambassador to the Russian Federation (2012-2014).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This in-person event is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/KpygQDtEkUsd4sSZA"&gt;Registration is required.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Historic US Land Record Search at Branner Earth Sciences Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you heard of "public lands" but you're not quite sure what that means? Are you curious about what California's land looked like in the past? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Join us for an introduction to searching for historic land records&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt; and a tutorial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;on using the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;US Federal &lt;a href="https://glorecords.blm.gov/"&gt;General &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://glorecords.blm.gov/"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;Land&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt; Office &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;Record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://glorecords.blm.gov/"&gt;s database&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;This publicly-accessible database is maintained by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and contains thousands of land records, maps, and surveys that contain a multifaceted history of the American West (and beyond).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;In this session, we’ll cover how to find master title plats, cadastral surveys, surveyor’s field notes, as well as original patent documents (focusing on California) so if you want to learn how the US Federal government documents federal and private &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt;land&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:start;"&gt; title, rights, and usage, this workshop is for you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are many uses of these primary source documents; whether you have an interest in history, federal law and governance, natural resources (agriculture, mining, forestry etc), land use (urbanization, privatization, environmentalism etc), or surveying and cartography, there should be something in this session for you! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We'll begin with an overview of &lt;b&gt;native lands&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;US federal public land management&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;surveying&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;legal land descriptions&lt;/b&gt;. Then we'll shift to a hands on demonstration of the GLO Records Database for searching and downloading land record documents. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Attendees should arrive with their own laptops if they wish to participate. Compters will not be provided. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="descnormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please note that this workshop series is only open to current Stanford University Affiliates, with full SunetID privileges.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Silicon Valley Talks: Patrick McCray, "README: A Bookish History of Computing from Electronic Brains to Everything Machines" at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join the Silicon Valley Archives in welcoming Patrick McCray to talk about his latest book, &lt;i&gt;README: A Bookish History of Computing from Electronic Brains to Everything Machines&lt;/i&gt;, on January 21, 2026, at 4:00 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;README&lt;/i&gt;, historian Patrick McCray argues that in order for computers to become ubiquitous, people first had to become interested in them, learn about them, and take the machines seriously. A powerful catalyst for this transformation was, ironically, one of the oldest information technologies we have: books. The author uses a carefully chosen selection of books, some iconic and others obscure, to describe this technological revolution as it unfolded in the half century after 1945. The book begins with a fundamental question: How does a new technology become well-known and widespread? McCray answers this by using books as a window into significant moments in the history of computing, books, publishing, and American culture.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;README&lt;/i&gt; offers a literary history of computers and, more broadly, information technologies between World War II and the dot.com crash of the early twenty-first century. From the electronic brains and cybernetics craze of the 1940s to the birth of AI, the rise of the personal computer, and the Internet-driven financial frenzy of the 1990s, books have proven a durable and essential way for people to learn how to use and think about computers. By offering a readable half-century of bookish history, &lt;i&gt;README &lt;/i&gt;explains how computers became popular and pervasive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;House&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Gitai's first film, House (1980), is about a house in West Jerusalem that belonged to a Palestinian family until 1948. The film traces the succession of its owners and residents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;During the 1948 war, the Dajani family left their home, and the Israeli government housed Algerian Jewish immigrants, the Toboul family, there. At the end of the 70’s a renowned Israeli economist bought the house and the Tobouls were relocated to public housing, on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Now, the new owner wants to transform this house into a three-story villa. To do so, he has to bring stones from a quarry south of the West Bank, and Palestinian workers from refugee camps around Hebron.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This house is therefore the subject of this documentary, which offers a series of biographical fragments. It’s a kind of microcosm, a metaphor for Jerusalem, with its human archaeological layers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;About the Filmmaker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;AMOS GITAI is an artist and filmmaker. He was born in Haifa, Israel, in 1950 to Munio Weinraub, an architect trained at the Bauhaus, and Efratia Margalit, an intellectual and teacher. He holds a Ph.D. in Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Internationally known for his documentaries and feature films about the Middle East, the Arab Israeli conflict, and personal and collective memory, Gitai was wounded during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, when a medical evacuation helicopter in which he was travelling was hit by a Syrian missile. He has drawn on biographical, familial and generational themes throughout his career, as well as the trauma of war and the celebration of life in the face of adversity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;To date, Gitai has created over ninety films, spanning a wide variety of formats including feature-length and short films, fiction and documentaries, experimental works, television productions, and also installations or theater plays. His work has been presented in several major retrospectives around the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;The Amos Gitai Archive at Stanford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;For the past nine years, Stanford University Libraries has been steadily collecting the archives of Amos Gitai’s work, both documentary and fiction, including the House documentary trilogy: House (1980), A House in Jerusalem (1998), News from Home / News from House (2005); the border trilogy: Promised Land (Terre promise) (2004), Free Zone (2005), Disengagement (2007); and two films centered on the Holocaust : One Day You’ll Understand (Plus tard tu comprendras) (2008) and Tsili (2014), both adaptations of literary works. More recently, the collection was expanded to include Gitai’s theater adaptation of the House trilogy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Spanning more than forty years of work and representing ten and a half terabytes of data, this collection offers exceptional access to the creative process of a world-renowned artist—one who feels at home in the fields of cinema, architecture, theater, and art.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:11pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Questions?

      <title>Amos Gitai Film Festival Part 2: Rabin The Last Day Screening and Panel Discussion at Traitel Building</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Stanford University Libraries are pleased to host a screening of the Amos Gitai film Rabin The Last Day (2015) on Tuesday, January 27, 2026 in the Hauck Auditorium, Traitel Building. There will be a reception and a panel discussion to follow the screening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This event is free and open to the public, but registration is required to attend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Film Synopsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rabin The Last Day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the evening of Saturday, November 4, 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Nobel and Nobel Peace Prize winner Yitzhak Rabin is shot down with three bullets at the end of a huge rally for peace and against violence in the center of Tel Aviv. His killer, apprehended at the scene, turns out to be a twenty-five-year-old student and observant Jew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This feature film shot twenty years after Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination sheds light what made this tragic deed possible: A culture of hate fueled by hysterical rhetoric, paranoia, and political intrigue. The extremist rabbis who condemned Rabin by invoking an obscure religious ruling. The prominent rightwing politicians who joined in a campaign of incitement against Rabin. The militant Israeli settlers for whom peace meant betrayal. And the security agents who saw what was coming and failed to prevent it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Filmmaker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
