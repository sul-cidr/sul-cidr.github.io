      <title>Religion in Manga and Anime: A Poster Exhibition by IntroSems RELIGST 6N at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Introductory Seminar RELIGST 6N “Religion in Anime and Manga,” taught by Professor Michaela Mross, students explored religious themes and imagery in manga (Japanese comics) and anime (animated films or TV series). The exhibit on display in the East Asia Library features academic posters on manga and anime, such as &lt;i&gt;My Neighbor Totoro&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Kamisama Kiss&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Deathnote&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Jujutsu Kaisen&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&lt;/i&gt;, that the students created as their final projects. The posters aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the cultural and religious background of these modern works, produced for mainly entertainment purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is located in the 3rd floor exhibit cases at the East Asia Library. An opening reception will be held on Wednesday, March 13, from 1:30 - 2:45 PM in the East Asia Library, room 224.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibition is sponsored by Stanford Libraries, the East Asia Library, the Introductory Seminars Program, and the Department of Religious Studies&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Victoria Yau: “I slept in the mountain cloud” at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;黛文洵美：山水記憶&lt;br&gt;
Victoria Yau: “I slept in the mountain cloud” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sponsored by Stanford Libraries, the East Asia Library, and the Center for East Asian Studies. Organized and guest curated by Beryl Zhou, graduate student, Center for East Asian Studies, and Ellen Huang, Ph.D, distinguished practitioner at the Center for East Asian Studies and associate professor of art history and material culture at ArtCenter College of Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanghai-born artist Victoria Yau (1939–2023) created around 300 works of abstract ink paintings, watercolors, multimedia collages, prints, and textiles after she moved to the United States from Taipei. These artworks, spanning nearly half a century of art-making in Chicago, New York and the Southwest, testify to her commitment to abstraction and investment in material experimentation. Featuring a selection of works in a range of media—and complemented by the artist’s own writings, collections, and poetry—this exhibition asks viewers to consider the transformation of East Asian landscape painting from compositional structure into abbreviated form emphasizing texture and line. Gathered together here for the first time since her passing, the works and texts on display explore how Yau negotiated disparate experiences of geopolitical flux, immigration, and physical struggle throughout her seventy-year career. Modern in their simplicity but complex in their historical and international references, Victoria Yau’s mountain clouds, her own poetic reworking of the historical term for landscape painting, “mountain-water 山水,” signal the intricacies of international contemporary art through the vantage of an Asian diasporic woman artist.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Color Deceives: Le Corbusier &amp; Josef Albers at McMurtry Building</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bowes Library’s Spring 2024 exhibition, &lt;i&gt;Color Deceives&lt;/i&gt;, explores the color theories of modern artist Josef Albers (German-American, 1888-1976) and modern architect Le Corbusier (Swiss-French, 1887-1965). Albers famously wrote, “color deceives continually,” a statement that becomes increasingly true through observing the complex interactions of color he documents in &lt;i&gt;Interaction of Color &lt;/i&gt;(1963). Likewise, Le Corbusier believed color to be “a means as powerful as the ground plan and the section itself.” His designs turn to polychromatic color schemes to create cohesive interiors and generate specific spatial and mood effects. The featured items from Bowes Library’s special collections highlight color as a powerful tool in every kind of art making. Curated by Abigail Schweizer '24. Library hours: M-Th 9-7pm, Friday 9-5pm, Sunday 12-6pm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BLACK GRAPHIC DESIGN HISTORY POP-UP  at Green Library, Special Collections, Barchas Room, 2nd floor</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meet one of the artists - Traer Price&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standford Libraries celebrates the visit of artist and collection donor, Traer Price, with a Pop-up exhibit of the &lt;a href="https://guides.library.stanford.edu/Black_graphic_design_collections"&gt;Black Graphic Design History (BGDH) Collections&lt;/a&gt;. We will be featuring Traer Price's work along with selected examples from the Black Graphic Design History collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traer Price, a Stanford Alumna will be in Special Collections’s Barchas room to meet with students, faculty, and staff and talk about her work as a designer of fountain choreography for Water Entertainment Technologies (WET) in addition to her experiences as a Black woman in art and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Making a path for thriving is what Black people do, continuously. Celebrating beauty is what Black people do, instinctively. A willingness to evolve and dive again below "what is", into "what can be" is what black people bring to this country. I am part of that tradition, I am of that flow. It moves through me as shape in metal, as shadow in grapite, as movement and emotion made visible in water."  Excerpt from &lt;i&gt;From Colorism to Water Choreography: My Design Journey Inward, &lt;/i&gt;By Traer Price.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Cultural and Philosophical Roots of Russian Totalitarianism at Encina Commons, Room 123</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:16px;font-style:normal;text-align:justify;text-decoration:none;"&gt;Many Western assessments of Russian totalitarianism depart from the premises that although the country has no democratic tradition, the basic ideas about the state and the political subject current in Russian society are nonetheless the same as what Western socio-political discourses operate with. The goal of this lecture is to show that this is not the case. Russian totalitarianism has longstanding cultural roots based on the idea of historical messianism and national uniqueness (“the Russian soul”), which permeated also the modernizing discourses that developed in Russia, under the influence of Hegel, during the latter half of the 19th century and led to the establishment of the Bolshevist regime. As a result, all influential Russian political ideologies have jettisoned the citizenship-based political visions that derive from Enlightenment ideals and advocate instead a theory of the political subject that must find its self-realization in its sacrificial commitment to the Russian/Communist idea. In combination, these circumstances have given rise to both the Russian totalitarian doctrine and a society that actually sees itself in its terms.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rein Raud &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;is the Distinguished Professor of Asian and Cultural Studies at the School of Humanities, Tallinn University. His circle of research interests is broad and ranges from cultural semiotics and sociology to process philosophy and theories of the subject on the one hand, and various aspects of Asian and Western cultural history on the other. His academic books include Being in Flux: A Post-Anthropocentric Ontology of the Self (Polity, 2021), Asian Worldviews: Religions, Philosophies, Political Theories (Wiley-Blackwell 20121), Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture (Polity 2016) and Practices of Selfhood (together with Zygmunt Bauman, Polity 2015).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3IJPl8A"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;RSVP Here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New Deal &amp; The Federal Writers' Project at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-UT_h28D9ylo9I3qEOfJJXmbaL_Ol8wq4VIw_k6PEU4/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New Deal &amp;amp; The Federal Writers' Project | Selections from the Bruce and Rachel Jeffer Collection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on view May 6, 2024, through January 26, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by childhood automobile trips across the U.S. with his father and a lifelong love of American history and literature, Los Angeles attorney Bruce Jeffer assembled a magnificent collection—totaling nearly two thousand titles—of the Federal Writers’ Project and related WPA and New Deal publications. He and his wife Rachel gifted it to the Stanford Libraries Department of Special Collections in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created as a New Deal program within the Works Progress Administration in 1935, the Federal Writers’ Project (Federal Writers’ Program 1939–1943) employed as many as six thousand writers, researchers, and editors in fifty-two state and territorial offices and produced a prodigious number of publications—including the American Guide Series, oral histories, ethnographies, collections of folklore and books for children—well over one thousand, but likely many more: the exact number is unknowable, and new discoveries have surfaced in the wake of each successive bibliography. Over sixty years, Jeffer’s passion for collecting the output of the Federal Writers’ Project and its offshoots brought him into contact with the foremost antiquarian book dealers of the day, former Writers’ Project employees, and leading collectors across the United States. With his wife Rachel, he made great use of auctions, eBay, and trades with other notable collectors and dealers. Through the decades, he searched for these publications by visiting bookstores in towns and cities around the country, directly contacting booksellers, and later maintaining a private network of like-minded collectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two core influences in Jeffer’s collecting activities were his close relationship with collector Fred Board of Connecticut and collector/book dealer Arthur Scharf of Pennsylvania. Board’s own collection of the State Guides (apart from his larger FWP collection) later served as an inspiration to his great-nephew Scott Borchert, which led Borchert to write his recent excellent history of the Project, &lt;i&gt;Republic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America&lt;/i&gt; (New York, 2021). Besides selling and trading, Arthur Scharf was a source of bibliographic information on the FWP publications. Like most serious collectors of the FWP, when Evanell Powell self-published her ambitious (if amateur) WPA Writers’ Publication: &lt;i&gt;A complete bibliographic checklist… of items, major and minor, of the Federal Writers' Project and Program&lt;/i&gt; (Palm Beach, 1974), Jeffer took advantage of the information there to hunt for more titles—and to find many titles unknown to Powell, historians, and scholars. Of the over twelve hundred published FWP titles in the Jeffer collection, approximately one hundred and fifty FWP items were unknown to Powell and historians, thus representing an excellent opportunity for further research. The presence of sixteen original, unpublished FWP works adds significantly to the prospects for research in the collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collecting the often ephemeral publications that characterized the richness and diversity, as well as controversy, of the project’s output, Jeffer has been guided by a desire to document this seminal period in American history, preserve it for posterity, and make it broadly available to students and researchers. In addition to rare published items, Jeffer sought out unpublished material as well—always with an eye for unique material that, in the words of one FWP catalog, embodied the project’s mission of “presenting America to all Americans.”  His collection contains copies of a number of exceedingly scarce titles, typescripts of unpublished works, and presentation copies gifted to New Deal luminaries such as Harry L. Hopkins, as well as publications from allied agencies such as the Federal Art Project, the Museum Extension Project, the Federal Theatre Project, and the Federal Music Project.  &lt;br&gt;
As demonstrated throughout the exhibit, The FWP’s lasting influence on literary and ethnographic work since the 1930s is strong, and the cultural resonance of the project continues unabated—including serving as the inspiration for a proposed twenty-first-century FWP, congressional legislation (Bill # HR 3054) introduced during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021 by Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA and Stanford, B.A., B.S., '91) and Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Benjamin Stone, Associate Director of Special Collections and Curator for American and British History; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their expert cataloging of books and manuscripts: Nancy Lorimer, Kay Teel, and their staff in the Metadata Department; For their assessment of materials Kristen St. John and Kimberly Kwan in Conservation Services; For his photography services Wayne Vanderkuil in the Digital Production Group; Glynn Edwards, Ann Myers, Brian Bethel, Gurudarshan Khalsa and especially Esther Wan in the Collection Services division of the Department of Special Collections, and Ben Albritton and Ever Rodriguez in Rare Books, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public.

      <title>Looking Slowly at Early Modern Maps at Green Library, Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maps are incredibly rich documents that only reveal some of their secrets after slow and deliberate study, and it is precisely this aspect of maps that we will explore in this two-hour workshop. Chet Van Duzer will analyze several early modern maps and provide examples of important characteristics of them that can only be appreciated and understood through slow looking. He will also supply advice on how to study maps slowly, and workshop participants will consult historic maps to begin to practice looking slowly at them, with plenty of time for examining the maps together and asking questions. The goal of the workshop is that participants will gain experience and tools for engaging more fully with maps in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the speaker: &lt;span&gt;Chet Van Duzer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is a historian of cartography and a board member of the Lazarus Project at the University of Rochester, which brings multispectral imaging (a technology for recovering information from damaged manuscripts) to cultural institutions around the world. He &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;has published extensively on medieval and Renaissance maps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;; his recent books include &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Henricus Martellus’s World Map at Yale (c. 1491): Multispectral Imaging, Sources, and Influence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, published by Springer in 2019, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Martin Waldseemüller’s Carta marina of 1516: Study and Transcription of the Long Legends&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; published by Springer in 2020. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;His &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;book Frames that Speak: Cartouches on Early Modern Maps&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; was recently published by Brill. His current project is on self-portraits by cartographers that appear on maps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paper Worlds: Urbano Monte and the Global Renaissance at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Since its arrival in the Rumsey Map Center, the Milanese cartographer Urbano Monte’s 1587 world map has become one of the uniquely compelling artifacts in our collection.  One of three surviving manuscript copies, it shows us how an armchair traveler viewed the world from Milan at the end of the Renaissance.  Monte (1544-1613) created his map after witnessing the Tenshō embassy (1582-90) visit his city before returning to Japan.  Monte’s map was a product of global curiosity as well as a synthesis of Renaissance cartography, travel narratives, histories, and news of the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This workshop places Urbano Monte’s world map in its different contexts – local, regional, and global – through a discussion of cartography, geography, and in curiosity in an age of Iberian and Asian empires.  We will juxtapose his project of mapmaking in relation to the voyage of the Florentine merchant Francesco Carletti (1573-1636), whose account of his accidental circumnavigation of the world in 1594-1602 is being edited for new Italian and English editions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;This event is sponsored by the History Department, the Program in the History and Philosophy of Science, and the David Rumsey Map Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Organizer:  Zach Dakota Haines (Stanford, Music)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join the Stanford Camerata and the University of Southern California Early Music Ensemble for a concert that follows the Tenshō Embassy through music! In 1583, four young Japanese legates and their party from the Jesuit mission in Nagasaki embarked on a seven-year journey across the globe, to Rome and back. Their leader, Alessandro Valignano, sought to increase awareness of the mission and their financial needs, so he organized the embassy that represented Christian Japanese daimyōs to relay their obeisance the pope. Throughout their travels, the boys received music lessons, performed at the cathedrals and princely courts, and were present to numerous splendid performances as part of the grand pomp and circumstance surrounding their visit. We will perform vocal and instrumental music that the Japanese boys may have heard or played throughout the trip, featuring composers such as Carreira, Palestrina, Gabrieli, and many more. We will explore the role that music played in the seven-year-long embassy and the significance of a European musical presence in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tabletop Tuesdays: Rising Waters at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us as we explore how board game designers are creating games like &lt;i&gt;Rising Waters&lt;/i&gt; to help educators teach historical events in the classroom. &lt;a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/357416/rising-waters"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rising Waters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a cooperative game where players experience the Mississippi flood of 1927 through the lens of the local African-American population. The game is deliberately designed to foster difficult conversations about the Jim Crow South by having players confront two forces at the same time–racism and nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tabletop Tuesdays i&lt;/i&gt;s an event series held on the third Tuesday of each month. At these events, we feature a selection of board games and collection items from across SUL's holdings around a specific theme. Drop in to learn about the month's featured game(s) and/or try some of the board games we have for open play at the Silicon Valley Archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Russia's War in Ukraine and its Implications on European Security: Why should America care? at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join us for an engaging discussion with Ambassador of Estonia to the U.S. Kristjan Prikk and Director of the Freeman-Spogli Institute Michael McFaul on:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Russia's War in Ukraine and its Implications on European Security: Why should America care?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than ten years into Russia's war against Ukraine and more than two years after Moscow launched a full-scale aggression, there is still no end in sight to the largest military conflict in Europe after WWII. What are the implications of this war on the security of Europe but also on the United States? What would it take to end the war and in what kind of a world will we all live on the day after it's all over? The event will feature a discussion on the possibility of a viable Western strategy for success that not only saves Ukraine but also strengthens the United States' role as the leader of the free world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Estonia's Ambassador to the U.S. &lt;b&gt;Kristjan Prikk&lt;/b&gt; started his mission in Washington, D.C. in May 2021. He is a graduate of the US Army War College and has served as the National Security Coordinator to the Prime Minister. Prior to arriving in D.C., he was the Permanent Secretary of the Estonian Ministry of Defense. Among his previous assignments are two other tours in Washington as an Estonian diplomat and work on NATO-Russia and NATO-Ukraine topics at a time when these relationships were considerably less charged than today.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael McFaul&lt;/b&gt; is Director at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, the Ken Olivier and Angela Nomellini Professor of International Studies in the Department of Political Science, and the Peter and Helen Bing Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. He joined the Stanford faculty in 1995. He served for five years in the Obama administration, first as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs at the National Security Council at the White House (2009-2012), and then as U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation (2012-2014).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Opening remarks will be delivered by &lt;b&gt;Amir Weiner&lt;/b&gt;, Associate Professor of History and Director of Stanford's Center for Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The hybrid event is free and open to the public. To attend in person, &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/rwxd4BtZj1vHqhJ56"&gt;RSVP is requested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is part of &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/global-conversations-talk-series/"&gt;Global Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, a series of talks, lectures, and seminars hosted by Stanford University Libraries and &lt;a href="https://vabamu.ee/en/"&gt;Vabamu&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of educating scholars, students, leaders, and the public on the benefits of but also challenges related to sustaining freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

He and his wife Rachel gifted it to the Stanford Libraries Department of Special Collections in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
