      <title>Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the essence, and the form fades away at Lathrop Library</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;청계 차일수: 득의망상 (得意忘象)&lt;br&gt;
Cheonggea Ilsu Cha: Grasp the Essence, and the Form Fades Away&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stanford East Asia Library presents an exhibition by the South Korean artist Cheonggea Ilsu Cha from November 18, 2024 to February 20, 2025. Artist Cha has dedicated his 40-year career to the mastery of ‘literati’ painting.  The literati genre combines written word with a painterly interpretation of text, a form of art that has been practiced by the scholarly elite in Korea for over 400 years. His work has been featured at the prestigious Grand Art Exhibition of Korea, and he has held eight solo exhibitions.&lt;br&gt;
A significant number of Korean scholars practiced literati painting during the Joseon Dynasty, which extended from 1392 to 1897. Literati painting reflects the scholar’s observation, understanding and interpretation of a poetic topic. The artist strives for aesthetic discipline; the text must be no longer than what the topic minimally requires. So too must the artist seek simplicity in his visual vocabulary.  The exhibition is inspired by the philosophy of Tŭgŭi mangsang (得意忘象), which emphasizes abandoning artifice in order to seek the true nature of things.  The works at the exhibition employ the use of ink and a constrained palette of color using materials such as traditional Korean paper, scrolls, and fans. The paintings touch on a wide variety of topics, from nature to philosophical reflections to expressions of human emotion. Cha’s work is inspired by the artistic sensibility of his predecessors. Visitors to the museum will find paintings imbued with a classic aesthetic, timeless charm, and a lively wit.&lt;br&gt;
This exhibition of Cha’s Korean literati paintings was curated by Jee-Young Park, Korean Studies Librarian at Stanford East Asia Library; Ji Soo Kim, M.A. in  Museum Studies from San Francisco State University; and Wooju Chong, M. A. in Center for East Asian Studies from Stanford University, in consultation with the East Asia Library Exhibits Committee.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>To Trust or Not to Trust: Authenticity by Design at Hohbach Hall</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet is at an inflection point. With the growth of mis/disinformation, artificial intelligence and synthetic media, trust in information faces unprecedented threats. Authenticity is not guaranteed. At the same time, new technologies–referred to as “Web 3”–present opportunities to protect the integrity of data. These solutions can be applied to critical practices including investigative journalism, historical archiving, and the admissibility of legal evidence. This exhibit, curated by the &lt;a href="https://www.starlinglab.org/"&gt;Starling Lab for Data Integrity&lt;/a&gt;, asks: How might we design information systems for authenticity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This exhibit is free and open to the public. &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/visitor-access" style="text-decoration:none;"&gt;Learn more about visiting Stanford Libraries on our website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The New Deal &amp; The Federal Writers' Project at Green Library, Bing Wing</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stanford Libraries presents &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-UT_h28D9ylo9I3qEOfJJXmbaL_Ol8wq4VIw_k6PEU4/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The New Deal &amp;amp; The Federal Writers' Project | Selections from the Bruce and Rachel Jeffer Collection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on view May 6, 2024, through January 26, 2025, in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda, Cecil H. Green Library, Bing Wing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by childhood automobile trips across the U.S. with his father and a lifelong love of American history and literature, Los Angeles attorney Bruce Jeffer assembled a magnificent collection—totaling nearly two thousand titles—of the Federal Writers’ Project and related WPA and New Deal publications. He and his wife Rachel gifted it to the Stanford Libraries Department of Special Collections in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created as a New Deal program within the Works Progress Administration in 1935, the Federal Writers’ Project (Federal Writers’ Program 1939–1943) employed as many as six thousand writers, researchers, and editors in fifty-two state and territorial offices and produced a prodigious number of publications—including the American Guide Series, oral histories, ethnographies, collections of folklore and books for children—well over one thousand, but likely many more: the exact number is unknowable, and new discoveries have surfaced in the wake of each successive bibliography. Over sixty years, Jeffer’s passion for collecting the output of the Federal Writers’ Project and its offshoots brought him into contact with the foremost antiquarian book dealers of the day, former Writers’ Project employees, and leading collectors across the United States. With his wife Rachel, he made great use of auctions, eBay, and trades with other notable collectors and dealers. Through the decades, he searched for these publications by visiting bookstores in towns and cities around the country, directly contacting booksellers, and later maintaining a private network of like-minded collectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two core influences in Jeffer’s collecting activities were his close relationship with collector Fred Board of Connecticut and collector/book dealer Arthur Scharf of Pennsylvania. Board’s own collection of the State Guides (apart from his larger FWP collection) later served as an inspiration to his great-nephew Scott Borchert, which led Borchert to write his recent excellent history of the Project, &lt;i&gt;Republic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America&lt;/i&gt; (New York, 2021). Besides selling and trading, Arthur Scharf was a source of bibliographic information on the FWP publications. Like most serious collectors of the FWP, when Evanell Powell self-published her ambitious (if amateur) WPA Writers’ Publication: &lt;i&gt;A complete bibliographic checklist… of items, major and minor, of the Federal Writers' Project and Program&lt;/i&gt; (Palm Beach, 1974), Jeffer took advantage of the information there to hunt for more titles—and to find many titles unknown to Powell, historians, and scholars. Of the over twelve hundred published FWP titles in the Jeffer collection, approximately one hundred and fifty FWP items were unknown to Powell and historians, thus representing an excellent opportunity for further research. The presence of sixteen original, unpublished FWP works adds significantly to the prospects for research in the collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collecting the often ephemeral publications that characterized the richness and diversity, as well as controversy, of the project’s output, Jeffer has been guided by a desire to document this seminal period in American history, preserve it for posterity, and make it broadly available to students and researchers. In addition to rare published items, Jeffer sought out unpublished material as well—always with an eye for unique material that, in the words of one FWP catalog, embodied the project’s mission of “presenting America to all Americans.”  His collection contains copies of a number of exceedingly scarce titles, typescripts of unpublished works, and presentation copies gifted to New Deal luminaries such as Harry L. Hopkins, as well as publications from allied agencies such as the Federal Art Project, the Museum Extension Project, the Federal Theatre Project, and the Federal Music Project.  &lt;br&gt;
As demonstrated throughout the exhibit, The FWP’s lasting influence on literary and ethnographic work since the 1930s is strong, and the cultural resonance of the project continues unabated—including serving as the inspiration for a proposed twenty-first-century FWP, congressional legislation (Bill # HR 3054) introduced during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2021 by Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA and Stanford, B.A., B.S., '91) and Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is curated by Benjamin Stone, Associate Director of Special Collections and Curator for American and British History; produced and designed by Deardra Fuzzell, Manager and Designer of Exhibitions.  Special thanks to the many colleagues in the Stanford Libraries who helped to make the exhibition possible: For their expert cataloging of books and manuscripts: Nancy Lorimer, Kay Teel, and their staff in the Metadata Department; For their assessment of materials Kristen St. John and Kimberly Kwan in Conservation Services; For his photography services Wayne Vanderkuil in the Digital Production Group; Glynn Edwards, Ann Myers, Brian Bethel, Gurudarshan Khalsa and especially Esther Wan in the Collection Services division of the Department of Special Collections, and Ben Albritton and Ever Rodriguez in Rare Books, and Tim Noakes, Leif Anderson, and Kylee Diedrich in Public Services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Exhibit cases in the Peterson Gallery and Munger Rotunda are illuminated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to call 650-723-0931 or visit the &lt;a href="https://library.stanford.edu/libraries_collections/hours_locations.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Library Hours page &lt;/a&gt;to confirm hours and access.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epicenters: Navigating Recovery and Renewal from Disasters at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;In the wake of disaster, maps play many roles, shaping understanding of the event in the immediate aftermath, serving as visceral portrayals for those who were not there, and communicating both scale and extent of the tragedy. They gavanize support for rebuilding by showing new possible futures and can be used to memorialize the event, inscribing the memory over the landscape. Drawing upon sources from historical representations to contemporary satellite imagery, the maps in this exhibition explore various ways communities use maps to make sense of calamity and move forward from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;The exhibition was curated by Stanford student Muhammad Dhafer, winner of the 2024 California Map Society student exhibition competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This exhibition is ongoing and will be available until February 28th, 2024. To view the exhibit, visit the David Rumsey Map Center during its public drop-in hours.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A World Made By Travel: The Digital Grand Tour at David Rumsey Map Center</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_biggest"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A World Made By Travel: The Digital Grand Tour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_bigger"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exploring the Challenges and Opportunities of Digital History and Publishing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Event:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Travel back to eighteenth-century Italy as we explore &lt;i&gt;A World Made by Travel&lt;/i&gt;, a pioneering digital history publication in open access by esteemed Stanford scholar &lt;b&gt;Giovanna Ceserani&lt;/b&gt;. Through this interactive work combining data and humanistic approaches, Ceserani and her team illuminate the journeys of more than 6,000 travelers who embarked on the Grand Tour, a popular rite of passage for young Europeans that helped shape cultural and political perspectives across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Giovanna Ceserani&lt;/b&gt; will be joined by panelists &lt;b&gt;Paula Findlen &lt;/b&gt;(world-renowned scholar of early modern Europe and Ubaldo Pierotti Professor of History at Stanford), &lt;b&gt;Mae Velloso-Lyons &lt;/b&gt;(Associate Director of the Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry and Digital Publishing in the Humanities at Emory University),&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Rochelle Lundy &lt;/b&gt;(Director of the Stanford Libraries Office of Scholarly Communications and expert of Open Access policies).&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Together they will&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;examine how digital technology using data and dynamic tools in open access brings new insights into historical research, enabling us to rediscover the Grand Tour’s impact on Enlightenment ideas about art, politics, leisure, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event Highlights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:30 - 3 PM: Presentation and Panel Discussion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will open with &lt;b&gt;Giovanna Ceserani’s&lt;/b&gt; introduction of her digital publication &lt;i&gt;A World Made by Travel&lt;/i&gt;. Following this, respondents &lt;b&gt;Paula Findlen&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Mae Velloso-Lyons&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Rochelle Lundy&lt;/b&gt; will speak about the unique challenges and exciting possibilities of digital history and open-access publishing. The discussion will cover how digital formats in open access can reveal hidden histories, democratize access to academic work, and reshape our understanding of complex historical narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 - 4 PM: Interactive Digital Display&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees will have the opportunity to engage directly with &lt;i&gt;A World Made by Travel&lt;/i&gt; on interactive screens, exploring data visualizations and stories of diverse Grand Tour travelers. This immersive experience allows users to delve into the digital maps and timelines that trace the lives and paths of travelers from all backgrounds who contributed to this transformative period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eighteenth-Century Primary Sources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a richer historical context, a curated set of original eighteenth-century sources will be on display, providing attendees with a tangible connection to the narratives highlighted in Ceserani’s digital work. This viewing will offer a hands-on experience of the artifacts that document these historical journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZXn2VcB9pwQjntyM_1hFtq1Se6g7YnNjK92gRpI_z9mF9AA/viewform"&gt;Please register in advance to attend&lt;/a&gt;. This event is in-person only. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Celebrating the Inauguration of Ustad Farida Mahwash's Archive at Stanford University Libraries at Munger Complex</title>
      <description>&lt;p class="desc_normal" style="text-align:start;"&gt;Join us for an esteemed gathering on&lt;b&gt; January 18, 2025&lt;/b&gt;, from &lt;b&gt;4:00 PM to 6:00 PM&lt;/b&gt; at Paul Brest Hall, Stanford University. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeoDKv__RzqvjphIYbFcuaYB7HJr-mxbK60xVTqxNkygw4hqw/viewform"&gt;Please RSVP by January 10th&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal" style="text-align:start;"&gt;This momentous event will feature a compelling conversation between&lt;b&gt; Ustad Farida Mahwash&lt;/b&gt;, a celebrated icon of Afghan music, and Mrs. Farida Anwary, one of Afghanistan's most distinguished journalists, orators, and announcers on radio and television. Together, they will delve into the profound impact of Ustad Mahwash's contributions to music, exploring themes of cultural resilience, artistry, and heritage. The discussion will also highlight some of the treasures within Ustad Mahwash's archive, showcasing the rich tapestry of her artistic contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal" style="text-align:start;"&gt;We invite scholars, students, and community members to engage in this enriching dialogue, celebrating not only Ustad Mahwash's legacy but also the vibrant cultural narratives of Afghanistan. Please note that the conversation will be in both Persian and English.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal" style="text-align:start;"&gt;A light reception with snacks and refreshments will follow the conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="desc_normal" style="text-align:start;"&gt;We look forward to your presence as we honor the intersection of music, culture, and scholarship at this historic event.  &lt;/p&gt;
